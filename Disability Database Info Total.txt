About Addison's Disease
Addison's disease is a rare endocrine, or hormonal disorder that affects about 1 in 100,000 people. It occurs in all age groups and affects men and women equally. The disease is characterized by weight loss, muscle weakness, fatigue, low blood pressure, and sometimes darkening of the skin in both exposed and nonexposed parts of the body. Addison's is a severe or total deficiency of the hormones made in the adrenal cortex.
Addison's Disease and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Addison's Disease
People with Addison's Disease may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with Addison's Disease will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Aging
As Americans age, more people over 65 are staying healthy and working longer, raising the average worker age. While many older workers have chronic conditions, most can continue working productively—some without accommodations and others with simple adjustments. Age-related conditions may include heart disease, arthritis, obesity, diabetes, depression, anxiety, low vision, hearing impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and other cognitive, sensory, or physical limitations. 
Aging and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).

About Albinism
Albinism refers to a group of rare disorders that are inherited genetically and result in a lack or complete loss of pigment in the skin, hair, and irises of the eyes. The lack of pigment, specifically melanin, causes the skin to be lighter in color and more vulnerable to ultraviolet (UV) rays. Albinism can also cause a variety of visual impairments including involuntary back-and-forth movements of the eyes (nystagmus), inability to focus both eyes on a single point (strabismus), extreme near/farsightedness, and sensitivity to light, or photophobia. The severity of symptoms resulting from albinism varies and not all individuals with albinism will need accommodations.
Albinism and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).

About Alcoholism
Alcoholism, also called “alcohol dependence,” is a disease that includes four symptoms: craving (a strong need, or compulsion, to drink), loss of control (the inability to limit one’s drinking on any given occasion), physical dependence (withdrawal symptoms, such as nausea, sweating, shakiness, and anxiety, occur when alcohol use is stopped after a period of heavy drinking), and tolerance (the need to drink greater amounts of alcohol in order to “get high”). Alcoholism treatment works for many people, but just like any chronic disease, there are varying levels of success when it comes to treatment. Alcoholism treatment programs use both counseling and medications to help a person stop drinking.
JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations. 
Alcoholism and the Americans with Disabilities Act
Is alcoholism a disability under the ADA?
The ADA does not contain a list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA has a general definition of disability that each person must meet. A person has a disability if he/she has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Does an employer have to allow use of alcohol at work as an accommodation?
No. The ADA specifically provides that an employer may prohibit the use of alcohol in the workplace and require that employees not be under the influence of alcohol. The Act permits employers to ensure that the workplace is free from the use of alcohol and does not interfere with employers' programs to combat the use of alcohol (EEOC, 1992).
Are tests for alcohol use considered medical tests under ADA?
Yes. Blood, urine, and breath analyses to check for alcohol use are considered medical exams, and therefore are subject to ADA limitations. According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), an employer's ability to make disability-related inquiries or require medical examinations is analyzed in three stages: pre-offer, post-offer, and employment. At the first stage (prior to an offer of employment), the ADA prohibits disability-related inquiries and medical examinations. At the second stage (after an applicant is given a conditional job offer, but before s/he starts work), an employer may make disability-related inquiries and conduct medical examinations, regardless of whether they are related to the job, as long as it does so for all entering employees in the same job category. At the third stage (after employment begins), an employer may make disability-related inquiries and require medical examinations only if they are job-related and consistent with business necessity (EEOC, 2000).
May an employer subject an employee, who has been off from work in an alcohol rehabilitation program, to periodic alcohol testing when s/he returns to work?
Yes, according to the EEOC, “but only if the employer has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that the employee will pose a direct threat in the absence of periodic testing. Such a reasonable belief requires an individualized assessment of the employee and his/her position and cannot be based on general assumptions. Employers also may conduct periodic alcohol testing pursuant to "last chance" agreements (EEOC, 2000).
In determining whether to subject an employee to periodic alcohol testing (in the absence of a "last chance" agreement), the employer should consider the safety risks associated with the position the employee holds, the consequences of the employee's inability or impaired ability to perform his/her job functions, and how recently the event(s) occurred that cause the employer to believe that the employee will pose a direct threat (e.g., how long the individual has been an employee, when s/he completed rehabilitation, whether s/he previously has relapsed). Further, the duration and frequency of the testing must be designed to address particular safety concerns and should not be used to harass, intimidate, or retaliate against the employee because of his/her disability. Where the employee repeatedly has tested negative for alcohol, continued testing may not be job-related and consistent with business necessity because the employer no longer may have a reasonable belief that the employee will pose a direct threat (EEOC, 2000).
Example A: Three months after being hired, a city bus driver informed his supervisor of his alcoholism and requested leave to enroll in a rehabilitation program. The driver explained that he had not had a drink in more than 10 years until he recently started having a couple of beers before bed to deal with the recent separation from his wife. After four months of rehabilitation and counseling, the driver was cleared to return to work. Given the safety risks associated with the bus driver's position, his short period of employment, and recent completion of rehabilitation, the city can show that it would be job-related and consistent with business necessity to subject the driver to frequent periodic alcohol tests following his return to work (EEOC, 2000).
Example B: An attorney has been off from work in a residential alcohol treatment program for six weeks and has been cleared to return to work. Her supervisor wants to perform periodic alcohol tests to determine whether the attorney has resumed drinking. Assuming that there is no evidence that the attorney will pose a direct threat, the employer cannot show that periodic alcohol testing would be job-related and consistent with business necessity” (EEOC, 2000).
Accommodating Employees with Alcoholism
People with alcoholism may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with alcoholism will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Allergies
An allergy is an inflammatory reaction that occurs when a person ingests, inhales, or touches a substance to which their body’s immune system has become sensitized. Common allergens include foods such as peanuts and tree nuts, animal-related materials such as pet dander, and airborne substances such as pollen.
The immune system of a person with allergies produces antibodies, which cause reactions that can range from itchiness, digestive distress, or inflamed sinuses to serious medical emergencies such as anaphylaxis. Allergies can be managed through various treatment options including medication, avoidance of substances to which one is allergic, and immunotherapy.
In addition, individuals sometimes refer to other conditions as "allergies." For example, an employee with reactive airway disease might say they are allergic to perfumes when in fact their airways react to perfumes due to their respiratory condition rather than an antibody reaction. Likewise, individuals with conditions such as dermatitis may describe themselves as allergic to the substances that cause them to experience skin irritation although they may not have a formally diagnosed allergy.
 
Allergies and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Allergies
People with allergies have various limitations, depending on the type and severity of the allergy. Therefore, effective accommodations will vary. The following information provides suggestions for processing an accommodation request related to allergies and some general accommodations to explore. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Ask:
Does the employee know what the specific allergen(s) is?
Before accommodations can be fully explored, it is useful to find out what the specific allergen is. In some cases, the employee may not know, but may have a general idea.
How is the allergy triggered?
Many allergies are triggered by inhaling the allergen, but other types of triggers are possible such as the allergen touching the skin. In some cases, there might be more than one type of exposure at issue. Knowing how the allergy is triggered can help an employer explore accommodation options.
Questions to Consider:
1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations
When accommodating employees with allergies, the main accommodation options include removing the allergen, removing the employee from where the allergen is located, or eliminating or reducing exposure to an acceptable level. It can also be useful to have a plan of action should exposure occur.
Remove the Allergen:
When possible, an employer should try to remove the allergen, especially if the allergen is unique to the work environment, minimal and/or the employer has control over it.
Move the Employee:
When it is not possible to remove the allergen or if the specific allergen is unknown, an employer may be able to move the employee away from the allergen. This usually means working at home or in a private office. Unless the employee wants to work at home, other options should be explored first to keep the employee in the workplace.
Reduce Exposure:
If the allergen cannot be removed and the employee cannot be moved completely away from the allergen, it may be possible to reduce the employee's exposure to an acceptable level. This usually means offering the employee a private office with optimal ventilation and minimum exposure to others. HEPA filtration may be useful in addressing air quality issues if the equipment selected is suitable both for the target allergen and the workspace. Additional accommodations to consider include allowing the individual to wear a mask or respirator or protective clothing. Some individuals can wear masks/respirators while others may not be able to wear them or be comfortable wearing them. Employers should keep in mind that they cannot force an employee to use a mask/respirator.
Plan of Action:
If there continues to be a risk of exposure, a plan of action may be needed. JAN provides a sample plan as a starting point.

About Alzheimer's Disease
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder named for the German physician Alois Alzheimer who first described it in 1906. Alzheimer’s disease damages and eventually destroys brain cells, leading to loss of memory, thinking, and other brain functions. Alzheimer's is not a part of normal aging, but results from a complex pattern of abnormal changes. It usually develops slowly and gradually gets worse as more brain cells wither and die. Alzheimer's is fatal, and currently there is no cure. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, a general term used to describe various diseases and conditions that damage brain cells. Symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease progress from mild forgetfulness to widespread brain impairment. Chemical and structural changes in the brain slowly destroy the ability to create, remember, learn, reason, and relate to others.
Early-stage Alzheimer’s is when the problems with memory, thinking, and concentration may begin to appear in a doctor’s interview or medical tests. Individuals in the early-stage typically need minimal assistance with simple daily routines. However, at the time of diagnosis, an individual is not necessarily in the early-stage of the disease. The term early-onset or younger-onset refers to Alzheimer’s that occurs in persons under the age of 65. Younger-onset individuals may be employed or have children still living at home. Early-onset Alzheimer's has been known to develop between ages 30 and 40, but it is more common for someone in his or her 50s to have the disease.
JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations.
Alzheimer's Disease and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Alzheimer's Disease
People with Alzheimer’s disease may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with Alzheimer’s disease will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Helpful Hints for the Accommodation Process 
Employee:
* Before your condition significantly affects your ability to effectively do your job, talk to your employer. A full conversation with your employer is vital for success.  
* Familiarize yourself, your spouse, and/or caregiver with your benefits and contact the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), if available.
* Explore your rights under the ADA.  Contact JAN for assistance. 
* Encourage a support person or team, possibly a family member(s) familiar with the effects of the disease, to be part of the process.  
Employer:
* A full conversation with the employee is vital for success. Keep an open mind about possible accommodations. 
* With assistance from the employee’s doctor, determine how quickly the disease may progress.  This will help in ascertaining the long-term accommodations that may need to be made.  As the disease progresses, job-related tasks will likely become more difficult to perform.  Providing accommodations so that the employee is able to continue working as long as possible may help to preserve an income and independence, as well as increase self-esteem.
* Encourage a support person or team, possibly a family member(s) familiar with the effects of the disease, to be part of the process.  
* Monitor the employee’s performance to ensure the accommodations are effective.  Some adjustments or changes in accommodations may be necessary.  Keep in mind that a reassignment may become necessary in some situations.

About Amputation
Amputation means the loss or absence of all or part of a limb. Causes of amputations include peripheral vascular disease (often associated with diabetes), trauma, tumors, and infections. In the United States, limb loss resulting from vascular conditions, referred to as dysvascular amputation, accounts for the majority of lower extremity amputations. Although the rates of limb differences due to congenital anomalies have remained consistent for several decades, dysvascular amputations have increased significantly.
Upper extremity amputations are most often a result of an accident or trauma, with recent warfare increasing the rate of occurrence in the United States. In general, upper extremity amputations occur more often in younger age groups. In the wake of an amputation, a new amputee could have a myriad of post-operative medical concerns such as pain management, infection, and controlling the swelling and shaping of the residual limb. Additionally, there will likely be a period of significant rehabilitation, with a wide range of therapeutic goals that will vary for each individual. Amputees may experience a wide range of emotions in response to the loss of a limb, including anxiety, sadness, depression, anger, and grief.
Amputation and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).

About Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)/Lou Gehrig's Disease
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), often referred to as "Lou Gehrig's disease," is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that attacks nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting the nerve cells of the spinal cord and brain. As ALS progresses, the motor neurons that span from the brain to the spinal cord to the muscles are destroyed, leading to loss of muscle control. This can lead to involuntary muscle movements as well as the inability to speak, swallow, and breathe. Two types of ALS are known: Familial (which is inherited) and Sporadic. Sporadic is the most common, comprising almost 95% of ALS cases. Around 20,000 people in the US have ALS and most are diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 70.
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)/Lou Gehrig's Disease and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)/Lou Gehrig's Disease
People with limitations from ALS may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with ALS will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
      1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
      2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
      3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
      4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
      5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
      6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Anxiety Disorder
Anxiety disorders affect millions of American adults. These disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, acute stress disorder, substance-induced anxiety disorder, anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition, anxiety disorder not otherwise specified, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, and specific phobias. Anxiety disorders are clinically distinct from transitional anxiety experienced during events such as a wedding, moving into a new home, dealing with the illness or death of a loved one, or beginning a new job. Individuals with anxiety disorders may experience feelings of panic; extreme physical, mental, or emotional stress; and intense fear. Due to the highly individualized nature of mental health conditions, symptoms can present in numerous ways and significantly impact the functionality of individuals with Anxiety Disorders.
Anxiety Disorder and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Anxiety Disorder
People with anxiety may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with anxiety will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
      1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
      2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
      3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
      4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
      5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
      6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations:
Managing Panic Attacks: For individuals with mental health conditions, having accommodations to help manage panic attacks can be helpful.

About Arthritis
Arthritis is a condition that includes inflammatory and noninflammatory diseases that affect the body's joints and connective tissue. Tendons, cartilage, blood vessels, and internal organs are also often affected. There are more than 100 different types of arthritis, but two of the more common are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid. Pain and swelling are often associated with arthritis.
Arthritis and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).

Be aware that not all people with arthritis will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
      1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
      2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
      3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
      4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
      5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
      6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Ataxia
Friedreich's, the best known inherited ataxia, and other cerebellar ataxias are impairments of the nervous system, most of which are inherited. They share many of the same symptoms, including unsteadiness and inability to coordinate movement. Friedreich`s Ataxia usually reveals itself in childhood while cerebellar ataxia is diagnosed more often in adults. A majority of individuals with ataxia use mobility aids and have difficulty with their speech, although mental abilities are unaffected. Other ataxias are idiopathic, that is, they just occur.
Ataxia and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Ataxia
People with ataxia may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with ataxia will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
      1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
      2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
      3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
      4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
      5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
      6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurobehavioral disorder that affects an estimated 6% of American adults and 10% of children. ADHD is usually diagnosed in childhood, and the condition can continue into the adult years. Many individuals with ADHD are undiagnosed until adulthood.
The common characteristics of ADHD are impulsivity, inattention, and/or over-activity. Failure to listen to instructions, inability to organize oneself and work tasks, fidgeting with hands and feet, talking too much, inability to stay on task, leaving projects, chores and work tasks unfinished, and having trouble paying attention to and responding to details are the primary symptoms of ADHD. Although individuals may have both inattention and hyperactivity symptoms, many individuals predominantly display one symptom more than another. There are three subtypes of ADHD:
      * ADHD predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type: The major characteristics are fidgeting, talking excessively, interrupting others when talking, and impatience.
      * ADHD predominantly inattentive type: The major characteristics are distractibility, organization problems, failure to give close attention to details, difficulty processing information quickly and accurately, and difficulty following through with instructions.
      * ADHD combined type: The individual with combined type meets the criteria for both hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive type.
Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
People with ADHD may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. There are some general accommodations that explain how people with ADHD disregard themselves at work. 
General: Individuals with ADHD are often perfectionists and are hard on themselves.  They have trouble setting personal boundaries like knowing when to stop working and they set unrealistic expectations for themselves.  Someone who takes work home or stays late to finish work is often given more responsibility or a heavier workload because they appear to be able to get their work done. General accommodations include: 
      * Help identifying strengths instead of focusing on weaknesses
      * Reinforcing creativity  
      * Pointing out any signs that the individual is overworked – not taking vacations, staying at work late frequently, not eating lunch
      * Providing an ADHD coach to suggest ways to increase productivity and maintain a healthy work-life balance
JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations. Be aware that not all people with ADHD will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
      1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
      2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
      3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
      4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
      5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
      6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations:

      *  Uninterrupted work time
      *  Taking allotted breaks as needed
      *  Minimizing marginal functions to allow focus on essential job duties
Time management: For individuals with ADHD, accommodations assisting with staying on task is often helpful

      *  Provide to-do lists
      *  Meetings to discuss expectations
      *  Assistance with prioritization
      *  Assistive technology (timers, apps, calendars, etc)
Strategies for the Individual with the disability
Getting to Work on Time: For individuals with ADHD, getting to work on time can often be difficult. 
      *  Have a routine of putting/keeping things in place 
      *  Prepare for the next day’s work the night before 
      *  Create checklists for yourself and others 
      *  Place sticky notes where you will see them 
      *  Turn off distractions – including cell phones

About Auditory Processing Disorder
An auditory processing disorder is a type of learning disability. Learning disabilities refer to a number of disorders that may affect the acquisition, organization, retention, understanding, or use of verbal or nonverbal information. These disorders affect learning in individuals who otherwise demonstrate at least average abilities essential for thinking and/or reasoning.
Learning disabilities result from impairments in one or more processes related to perceiving, thinking, remembering or learning. Learning disabilities range in severity and may interfere with the acquisition and use of oral language, reading, written language, and mathematics. Auditory processing disorder is the term used to describe a weakness in the ability to understand and use auditory information. Individuals may have difficulties with auditory discrimination. This includes the ability to notice, compare and distinguish the distinct and separate sounds in words — a skill that is vital for reading. Auditory figure-ground discrimination includes the ability to pick out important sounds from a noisy background. Auditory memory involves the short-term and long-term abilities to recall information presented orally. Auditory sequencing incorporates the ability to understand and recall the order of sounds and words. All of these difficulties may cause problems with writing, spelling, and reading.
Auditory Processing Disorder and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Auditory Processing Disorder
People with an auditory processing disorder may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with an auditory processing disorder will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
         1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
         2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
         3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
         4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
         5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
         6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations:
Auditory Distractions: Assess if there are audible distractions interfering with the employee’s ability to perform the job. Identify specific distractions and explore accommodation ideas such as rearranging or relocating the workspace, hanging sound absorption panels, encouraging non- work- related conversations to take place outside of work area, or allowing telework if appropriate.
Meetings/Training:
         * Consider the environment and what is going on in terms of background noises/voices
         * Minimize auditory distractions
         * Provide Assistive Listening Devices (ALD)
         * Allow preferential seating
         * Provide written agendas in advance
         * Provide materials in alternative formats
         * Provide printed minutes
         * Provide instructions, communications, etc., in writing as much as possible
         * Follow up verbal communications in writing
         * Allow the use of recorder/apps
         * Allow ample time for responses to oral communications/ questions
         * Demonstrate and explain new information and tasks
Communication:
         * Consider the environment and background noise
         * Minimize distractions
         * Slow the rate of speech
         * Simplify or minimize verbal communication/ instructions and follow up in writing
         * Allow written communication such as emails, texts, etc.
         * Allow ample time to respond to verbal communication/questions
         * Encourage employee to question/ repeat back information received
         * Be patient

About Autism Spectrum
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, including deficits in social reciprocity, nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, and skills in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships. For the diagnosis, the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities is required.
JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations. 
Autism Spectrum and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).

About Back Impairment
Back injuries account for many of the musculoskeletal disorders in the workplace. The major symptom of most back impairments is back pain, which can be localized or widespread radiating from a central point in the back. If ligaments and muscles are weak then discs in the lower back can become weakened. With excessive lifting, or a sudden fall, a disc can rupture. With years of back abuse, or with aging, the discs may simply wear out and a person may live with chronic pain for several years. However, back pain caused by a muscle strain or a ligament sprain will normally heal within a short time and may never cause further problems. Poor physical condition, poor posture, lack of exercise, and excessive body weight contribute to the number and severity of sprains and strains. Degeneration of the spine, due to aging, is also a major contributor to back pain.
Back Impairment and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Back Impairment
People with back impairments may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with back impairments will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
         1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
         2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
         3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
         4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
         5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
         6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

         * Distractibility
         * Increase in goal-directed activity
         * Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (spending sprees, sexual indiscretions, other risky behaviors)
Signs and symptoms of depression include distinct periods of:
         * Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism for most of the day
         * Diminished interest or pleasure in more, or all, activities

About Bladder Impairment
Bladder impairments tend to be caused by neurologic conditions, including spinal cord injuries, disease, cerebrovascular accidents, brain injuries, multiple sclerosis, and dementia. However, other conditions can also trigger bladder impairments, such as pregnancy, childbirth, weight, and medications. Some of the most common symptoms of a bladder impairment can be an inability to hold urine (functional incontinence), a strong need to urinate (urge incontinence), and leakage due to activity (stress incontinence). These can also lead to infections, stones, or renal damage. Interstitial cystitis is a specific bladder condition that can cause pressure and pain in the bladder. It also has symptoms similar to other bladder disorders, such as frequent urination, pain during sex, and waking at night to urinate.
Bladder Impairment and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Bladder Impairment
People with bladder impairments may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with bladder impairments will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
         1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
         2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
         3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
         4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
         5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
         6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Bleeding Disorder
Bleeding disorders are a group of conditions that result in poor blood clotting and extended bleeding time. People with bleeding disorders do not bleed more quickly than other people, just for a longer period of time. Some bleeding disorders are present at birth and are caused by rare inherited disorders. Others develop during certain illnesses or treatments. Von Willebrand disease and hemophilia are the most common hereditary bleeding disorders affecting at least 1% of the population. 
Generally, bleeding disorders make it difficult to stop bleeding when an injury occurs. With von Willebrand disease, prolonged bleeding may occur with minor cuts or during dental work. With hemophilia, internal bleeding into the joints is more common, especially into the knees, elbows, and ankles. This can cause stiffness and decreased range of motion and strength in the extremities and may ultimately cause chronic joint deformities. Some individuals who have joint deformities may undergo joint replacement operations. 
There are many plasma proteins called factors that are involved in the blood coagulation process, and if one or more are missing or deficient, the blood clotting process is affected. Treatment may consist of replacing the missing factors via nasal spray or injection to prevent bleeds before they start. Other individuals may have a need for infusions in life-threatening situations.
Bleeding Disorder and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment.

About Blindness
The term “blindness” generally refers to a lack of usable vision. Individuals with total blindness are unable to see anything with either eye. Legal blindness is defined as 20/200 or less in the better eye with the best possible correction. Many individuals who are considered legally blind still have some degree of useable vision.  
Blindness and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Blindness
People with blindness may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
         1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
         2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
         3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
         4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
         5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
         6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations:

About Body Odor
Employers are often uncomfortable dealing with hygiene problems such as body odor, incontinence, or inappropriate clothing. Some employers try to deal with these problems indirectly by sending anonymous notes or leaving soaps and deodorants on the employee’s desk. Unfortunately, ignoring hygiene problems or dealing with them indirectly may allow them to continue until they start interfering with the work of other employees or driving customers away.
People may have body odor for various reasons, including disability. Individuals with body odor may not be aware that their odor is offensive to others, so employers need to start by discussing the issue with the employee. If body odor results from a disability, employers should consider whether reasonable accommodation is appropriate. For employers who want to deal with hygiene problems directly, the following suggestions may be useful.
Where to Begin:
Employers may want to first decide who will deal with hygiene problems when they arise (e.g., human resources or the employee’s direct supervisor). The person chosen to deal with the problem should verify that the problem exists, by either making sure information about the problem came from a reliable source or through direct interaction with the employee who has the problem. Before talking with the employee, the employer should decide whether the source of the information will be provided to the employee, be prepared to discuss details about the problem, and be familiar with company policy and procedure related to such issues.
Discussing the Problem:
Once the employer is prepared to meet with the employee, the next step is to choose a place and time to meet. The meeting should be in a private area with enough time set aside for the employee to regain his/her composure, if needed, before returning to work.
When discussing the problem with the employee, the employer should be sensitive but direct, letting the employee know that he/she has a hygiene problem that must be addressed. In some cases, the employee may be unaware that a problem exists and may need specific information about what the problem is. The employer may need to describe the problem (e.g., smell of urine or feces, urine or feces left on office chairs, odor from flatulence, smell of sweat, bad breath, disheveled appearance) and let the employee know how it is affecting the workplace (e.g., bothering coworkers, customers complaining).
The employer should also let the employee know what is expected (e.g., when must the problem be fixed, what happens in the meantime, and what follow up will take place). If there is a specific company policy that addresses the issue, the employer should point it out or provide a copy. The employer also may want to make a general statement such as, “If I can help you resolve this problem, please let me know.”
If the employee has a disability, the employer should not assume that the hygiene problem is disability-related. There may be other causes for the problem besides the disability, such as personal problems, financial problems, cultural differences, or simply a failure to bathe. If the employee does not indicate that the problem is related to a disability, then the employer should proceed according to company policy. If the employee does indicate that the problem is related to a disability, then the employer should initiate an interactive process to determine whether the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) applies and whether there are accommodations that may resolve the problem.
 
Body Odor and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Body Odor
If the employee has a qualifying disability and the employer is covered by the ADA, the employer must consider accommodations. In some cases, an employee may be able to overcome a hygiene problem through medical treatment. In such cases, the only accommodations needed may be flexible scheduling or leave time for treatment. In other cases, the problem may not be correctable and the employer must consider other accommodation options. If the employee’s job does not require in-person interaction with coworkers or customers, it might be a reasonable accommodation to modify the hygiene policy for the employee or allow the employee to work from home.
On the other hand, if the employee’s job does require in-person interaction with coworkers and customers, the employer needs to explore accommodation options to reduce or eliminate the problem. If there are no accommodations, the employer does not have to allow the employee to continue working in his/her current job if the problem is affecting business. However, the employer should consider reassigning the employee to a job that does not involve in-person contact if one is available.
Questions to Consider:
         1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
         2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
         3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
         4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
         5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
         6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Brain Injury
The brain can incur several different types of injuries depending on the type, amount, and position of force impacting the head. The impact may affect one functional area of the brain, several areas, or all areas of the brain. These factors determine what types of accommodations are effective. JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations.

About Burn Injury
Burn injuries are classified in three ways: first, second, and third degree. First degree burns involve only the top layer of skin and are characterized by pain, redness, and swelling. Second degree burns involve the first and second layer of skin and are characterized by blistering of the skin, redness, and swelling and are very painful. Third degree burns are the most severe and often result in extensive scarring. They can require a long recovery time and may result in severe limitations.
Burn Injury and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Burn Injury
People with burn injuries may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with burn injuries will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
         1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
         2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
         3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
         4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
         5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
         6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

         * Reassigning an employee to a modified duty position or modifying duties by removing the lifting duties            
         * Periodic rest breaks to get up and move around 
         * Modified break schedule so that you can stretch your legs when needed

About Cancer
Cancer develops when cells in a part of the body begin to grow out of control. Although there are many kinds of cancer, they all start because of out-of-control growth of abnormal cells. Normal body cells grow, divide, and die in an orderly fashion. During the early years of a person's life, normal cells divide more rapidly until the person becomes an adult. After that, cells in most parts of the body divide only to replace worn-out or dying cells and to repair injuries. Because cancer cells continue to grow and divide, they are different from normal cells. Instead of dying, they outlive normal cells and continue to form new abnormal cells. Cancer cells often travel to other parts of the body where they begin to grow and replace normal tissue. This process, called metastasis, occurs as the cancer cells get into the bloodstream or lymph vessels of our body. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy. 
Some generalized symptoms and signs such as unexplained weight loss, fever, fatigue, or lumps may be seen in several types of cancer; however, other signs and symptoms are relatively specific to a particular type of cancer. Staging is the process of finding out how much cancer there is in the body and where it is located. Doctors use this information to plan treatment and to help determine a person's outlook (prognosis). Cancers with the same stage usually have similar outlooks and are often treated the same way. Staging is also a way doctors can communicate with each other about a person's case. For most cancers, the stage is based on three main factors: the original (primary) tumor's size and whether the tumor has grown into other nearby areas, whether the cancer has spread to the nearby lymph nodes, and whether the cancer has spread to distant areas of the body. 
Cancer and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Cancer
People with cancer may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
            1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
            2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
            3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
            4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
            5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
            6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations

About Cataplexy
Cataplexy is the sudden loss of voluntary muscle tone or temporary paralysis that is often triggered by extreme emotion, such as laughter or fear. Cataplexy by itself is considered a rare disease.  Most episodes are short in duration, lasting a few seconds up to five minutes. These episodes tend to have few, if any, residual effects.  Some people with narcolepsy can have cataplectic attacks almost daily, while there are some people with narcolepsy that have never experienced cataplexy. 
During a cataplectic attack the person will remain conscious; however, the person may experience jaw dropping, which can cause speech limitations, or eyelids drooping, which can interfere with vision. Other symptoms may include balance issues, upper extremity weakness, and/or collapsing.
While a cataplectic attack is usually very short in duration and leaves no residual effects, there may be symptoms that would require workplace accommodations. Some of the most common limitations stemming from a cataplectic attack are weakened speech, vision issues, trouble balancing, upper extremity weakness, and/or collapsing.
Cataplexy and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Cataplexy
People with cataplexy may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with cataplexy will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.

            5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
            6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Cerebral Palsy
Cerebral palsy (CP) is a term used to describe a group of chronic conditions affecting body movement and muscle coordination. It is caused by damage to one or more specific areas of the brain, usually occurring during fetal development; before, during, or shortly after birth; or during infancy. Thus, these disorders are not caused by problems in the muscles or nerves. Instead, faulty development or damage to motor areas in the brain disrupt the brain's ability to adequately control movement and posture.
"Cerebral" refers to the brain and "palsy" to muscle weakness/poor control. CP itself is not progressive; however, secondary conditions, such as muscle spasticity, can develop, which may get better over time, get worse, or remain the same.  CP is characterized by an inability to fully control motor function, particularly muscle control and coordination. Depending on which areas of the brain have been damaged, one or more of the following may occur: muscle tightness or spasticity; involuntary movement; disturbance in gait or mobility, difficulty in swallowing and problems with speech. In addition, the following may occur: abnormal sensation and perception; impairment of sight, hearing, or speech; and seizures. Other problems that may arise are difficulties in feeding, bladder and bowel control, problems with breathing because of postural difficulties, skin disorders because of pressure sores, and learning disabilities.
There are several types of CP: 
            * Spastic Cerebral Palsy: People with spastic CP have stiff and jerky movements because their muscles are too tight. Mobility and handgrip are difficult to control. This is the most common type of CP and affects half of all people with CP.
            * Ataxic Cerebral Palsy: Low muscle tone and poor coordination of movements is described as ataxic. Shakiness or tremors make writing, page turning or using a keyboard difficult to perform. Poor balance and unsteady walking requires extra mental concentration or more time to complete the movements.
            * Athetoid Cerebral Palsy: Athetoid refers to a type of CP involving mixed muscle tone, too high or too low. Random, involuntary movements result in movements of the face, arms and upper body. Walking, sitting upright and maintaining posture control takes extra work and concentration. About one fourth of people with CP have athetoid CP.
            * Mixed Cerebral Palsy: When muscle tone is too low in some muscles and too high in other muscles, the type of CP is called mixed. About one fourth of all people with CP have this type .
Cerebral Palsy and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Cerebral Palsy
People with cerebral palsy may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with cerebral palsy will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
            1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
            2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
            3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
            4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
            5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
            6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Charcot-Marie-Tooth
Charcot-Marie-Tooth, or CMT, is the most common inherited neurological disorder. CMT is found world-wide in all races and ethnic groups. It was discovered in 1886 by three physicians, Jean-Marie-Charcot, Pierre Marie, and Howard Henry Tooth. CMT patients slowly lose feeling in their feet/legs and hands/arms as nerves to the extremities degenerate. The muscles in the extremities become weakened because of the loss of stimulation by the affected nerves. Additionally, there is a loss of sensory abilities. 
Charcot-Marie-Tooth and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment.

About Chronic Pain
Chronic pain has been said to be the most costly health problem in America. While acute pain is a normal sensation triggered in the nervous system to alert you to possible injury and the need to take care of yourself, chronic pain is different. Chronic pain persists. Pain signals keep firing in the nervous system for weeks, months, even years or a lifetime. Living with chronic pain can lead to loss of appetite, depression, and exhaustion. The pain associated with chronic pain usually overwhelms all other symptoms. Chronic pain can be caused by headaches, low back pain, cancer pain, arthritis pain, pain in the nervous system, and psychological pain.
Chronic Pain and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Chronic Pain
People with chronic pain may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with arthritis will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
            1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
            2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
            3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
            4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
            5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
            6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Colorblind/Color Vision Deficiency
Color Vision Deficiency (CVD) is the inability to distinguish between some colors and shades. Most people with this condition can identify some colors. Few people are totally "color blind." Color filters, such as a special red contact lens worn on one eye or prescription glasses may be used to help some people with a color deficiency. In addition, talking products are available that will scan a color and announce a description of the color (originally designed for individuals who are blind).  


Colorblind/Color Vision Deficiency and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Colorblind/Color Vision Deficiency
People with color vision deficiency may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people who have have color vision deficiency will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
            1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
            2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
            3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
            4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
            5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
            6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations
Distinguishing Colors: Individuals with color vision deficiency may have difficulty distinguishing various colors. This deficiency exists on a spectrum, with few people being completely unable to see color. Performing job tasks that require employees to differentiate between colors, such as decorating cakes or assembling parts, may be challenging for those with color vision deficiency.
            * Labels
            * Prescribed glasses for color discrimination
            * Colored acetate sheets
            * Assistant to identify colors such as a volunteer or co-worker
            * Apps or devices to identify colors

About Cumulative Trauma Conditions
Cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) are impairments that are caused by repeated movements. Continuous use or pressure over an extended period of time results in wear and tear on tendons, muscles, and sensitive nerve tissue. The most common parts of the body affected are the wrists, hands, shoulders, knees, eyes, back, and neck. CTDs are groups of disorders with similar characteristics and may be referred to as: repetitive trauma disorders, repetitive strain injuries, overuse syndromes, regional musculoskeletal disorders, and work-related disorders. Examples of CTDs include:
            * Bursitis: Bursitis is a condition where the bursal sac becomes irritated and painful
            * Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS): CTS is a condition that results from pinching of one of the nerves in the wrist and hand. This nerve, the median nerve, is compressed as it passes through the wrist, and because of this compression, the nerve does not function properly.
            * Cubital Tunnel Syndrome: Cubital tunnel syndrome occurs when the ulnar nerve, one of the primary nerves supplying movement directions to the forearm muscles and sensory information from the hand, becomes compressed near the elbow.
            * DeQuervain's: Lateral DeQuervain's, sometimes referred to as tennis elbow, can result from excessive activities such as painting with a brush or roller, running a chain saw, and using many types of hand tools continuously. Medial Epicondylitis, sometimes referred to as golfer's elbow, can result from activities such as chopping wood with an ax, running a chain saw, and using many types of hand tools continuously.
            * Impingement Syndrome: Also known as rotator cuff syndrome, impingement syndrome is a result of the lack of room between the epicondylitis (upper part of shoulder blade bone) and the rotator cuff. Usually the tendons slide easily underneath the epicondylitis as the arm is raised; however, each time the arm is raised, there is a bit of rubbing on the tendons and the bursa between the tendons and the acromion. This rubbing, or pinching action, is called impingement. Continuously working with the arms raised overhead, repeated throwing activities, or other repetitive actions of the arm can result in impingement syndrome.
            * Radial Tunnel Syndrome: Radial tunnel syndrome, also called resistant tennis elbow, is an entrapment or compression of a nerve within the forearm. The symptoms of radial tunnel syndrome closely resemble tennis elbow, although the cause is different. Radial tunnel syndrome is caused when the nerve that operates several muscles around the wrist and hand (the posterior acromion nerve) is compressed or pinched, causing weakness of the muscles supplied by the nerve and pain over the elbow where the compression takes place.
            * Tendonitis: Tendonitis is a common condition that can cause significant pain. Tendonitis occurs when there is inflammation of tendons at the point where a muscle attaches to the bone.
            * acromion: Inflammation of the tendon sheaths that may follow trauma, overuse, or inflammatory conditions.
            * Trigger Finger: Trigger finger is a common condition caused by inflammation of the flexor tendons in the hand.
            * Thoracic Outlet Syndrome: Thoracic outlet syndrome is a condition characterized by pain in the neck, shoulders, and fingers and weakening of the grip.
The symptoms of CTDs are aching, tenderness, swelling, pain, crackling, tingling, numbness, weakness, loss of joint movement, and decreased coordination. There could be one or several causes of CTDs. The repetition of small, rapid movements; working in a static and/or awkward posture for long periods of time; insufficient recovery time (too few rest breaks); improper workstation setup; forceful movements; excessive grasping; and poor work techniques may contribute to injury. Some conditions associated with CTDs are: broken or dislocated bones, arthritis, thyroid gland imbalance, diabetes, hormonal changes from menopause, and pregnancy.

About Deafness
It is estimated that there are more than 28 million Americans who are deaf or hard of hearing. Hearing loss is the reduced ability to hear sound and may develop for various reasons. An individual may have a congenital loss from childhood or an adult illness that can result in total loss of hearing. The effects of aging, acute injury, or progressive loss over time due to excessive or prolonged exposure to noise may also result in deafness for some people. Individuals who are deaf may require accommodations to enable successful performance of essential job functions. Accommodations will not always be necessary, nor will they always be effective.
Deafness and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Deafness
People who are deaf may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people who are deaf will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
            1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
            2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
            3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
            4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
            5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
            6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Depression
Depression is an illness that involves feelings of sadness lasting for two weeks or longer, often accompanied by a loss of interest in life, hopelessness, and decreased energy. Such distressing feelings can affect one's ability to perform the usual tasks and activities of daily living. This is considered to be clinical depression. It is very different from a temporary case of "the blues" triggered by an unhappy event or stressful situation. Depression affects the mind, but this does not mean "it's all in your head."
Depression is a medical illness linked to changes in the biochemistry of the brain. Depression is not a weakness of character. Being depressed does not mean a person is inadequate. It means the person has a medical illness that is just as real as diabetes or ulcers. Like other medical disorders, clinical depression should not be ignored or dismissed. A clinically depressed person cannot simply "snap out of it" any more than a person with an ulcer could simply will it away.
JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations. 
Depression and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).

About Diabetes
Diabetes is a disease in which blood glucose levels are above normal. Most of the food we eat is turned into glucose, or sugar, for our bodies to use for energy. The pancreas, an organ that lies near the stomach, makes a hormone called insulin to help glucose get into the cells of our bodies. When you have diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use its own insulin as well as it should. This causes sugar to build up in your blood. Diabetes can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity amputations.
Type 1 diabetes was previously called insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or juvenile-onset diabetes. Type 1 diabetes develops when the body's immune system destroys pancreatic beta cells, the only cells in the body that make the hormone insulin that regulates blood glucose. This form of diabetes usually strikes children and young adults, although disease onset can occur at any age. Type 1 diabetes may account for 5% to 10% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes was previously called non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or adult-onset diabetes. Type 2 diabetes may account for about 90% to 95% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes. It usually begins as insulin resistance, a disorder in which the cells do not use insulin properly. As the need for insulin rises, the pancreas gradually loses its ability to produce insulin. Type 2 diabetes is associated with older age, obesity, family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes, impaired glucose metabolism, physical inactivity, and race/ethnicity.
Gestational diabetes is a form of glucose intolerance that is diagnosed in some women during pregnancy. During pregnancy, gestational diabetes requires treatment to normalize maternal blood glucose levels to avoid complications in the infant. After pregnancy, 5% to 10% of women with gestational diabetes are found to have type 2 diabetes.
Other specific types of diabetes result from specific genetic conditions (such as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)), surgery, drugs, malnutrition, infections, and other illnesses.
Healthy eating, physical activity, and insulin injections are the basic therapies for type 1 diabetes. The amount of insulin taken must be balanced with food intake and daily activities. Blood glucose levels must be closely monitored through frequent blood glucose testing.  
Diabetes and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Diabetes
People with diabetes may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with diabetes will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
            1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
            2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
            3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
            4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
            5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
            6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations
Hypo/Hyperglycemia: Individuals with diabetes may need to monitor glucose levels periodically and take appropriate action to ensure stability. Various methods may be used to monitor glucose levels, including lancing devices, apps, and service animals. Medication such as insulin may need to be stored in an area that is temperature-controlled and quickly accessible to the individual at all times. Scheduled meals or snacks may be necessary.
            * Allow for storage of medications, such as insulin and/or food
            * Provide an area to test blood sugar levels
            * Provide an area to administer medications (insulin)
            * Provide appropriate containers for needles/syringe disposal
            * Provide a rest area for reorientation after hypo/hyperglycemic episode
            * Allow frequent breaks for food as needed
            * Provide appropriate food for office-sponsored events and reward programs
            * Consider modifications to policies involving food storage and consumption
            * Allow service animal access
Neuropathy (Nerve damage): Individuals with diabetes may experience neuropathy resulting in pain, numbness, and weakness in parts of the body. This is most common in the legs and feet, but can impact other systems as well.
            * Modify job tasks requiring fine finger dexterity
            * Provide protective clothing and equipment
            * Eliminate or reduce the need to use sharp objects
            * Provide anti-fatigue mats or padded carpeting
            * Allow flexibility to sit or stand
            * Provide parking accommodations
Fatigue or Weakness: Decreased stamina can make it challenging for employees with diabetes to perform physical work tasks as well as maintain extended work hours. Rotating shifts and overtime can be particularly problematic.
            * Allow frequent rest breaks
            * Reduce or eliminate strenuous activities
            * Provide anti-fatigue mats or padded carpeting
            * Provide a rest area with cot
            * Allow flexibility to sit or stand
            * Allow job sharing
            * Shorten work day and extend work week
Vision Impairment: Vision impairment and blindness may result from diabetes. Vision may be blurred or obstructed and loss of sight can be progressive. Accommodations for diabetic vision loss are often similar to those resulting from other types of eye disease.
            * Note: Not a comprehensive listing of accommodation ideas. See Accommodation and Compliance: Low Vision and Accommodation and Compliance: Blindness
            * If the individual benefits from magnification, consider external magnification devices or computer screen magnification software
            * If the individual does not benefit from magnification, consider Braille, tactile graphics, or assistive technology (e.g., screen reading software)
            * If the individual is experiencing blurriness or haziness use of high contrast settings and themes may be helpful
            * Provide a digital voice recorder
            * Provide a qualified reader
            * Allow flexible schedule to use public transportation to and from work
            * Allow use of service animal for assistance with vision and/or mobility
            * If the individual experiences photosensitivity, consider alternative lighting such as lamps or fluorescent light filters
Kidney Disease: Some individuals with diabetes may experience impairments to kidney function. Depending on the advancement of the impairment, individuals may require dialysis to replace the filtration generally done by the renal system.
            *  Provide easy access to restroom facilities
            * Allow a flexible schedule or time off for treatment (dialysis)
            * Some individuals may be able to telework from the dialysis site
Cognitive Limitations: Impaired cognitive function may result in memory loss, difficulty managing time, organizational limitations, and executive dysfunction.
            *  Provide written job instructions and prioritize assignments
            * Increase job structure
            * Use of day planner or electronic organizer
            * Provide reminders
            * Provide flexible work hours
            * Minimize distractions
Psychological Limitations: Stress can cause a temporary rise in blood glucose levels, which may be detrimental to individuals with diabetes. Managing workplace stressors may be a necessary component to accommodating diabetes.
            * Reduce stress
            * Allow time off for counseling or therapy
Other Considerations:
            * Provide area to brush teeth to prevent periodontal gum disease
            * Evaluate safety hazards
            * Avoid temperature extremes to help deal with poor circulation
            * Educate coworkers on emergency situation procedures and identification of symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia

About Drug Addiction
Drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing, and treatable disease. Addiction begins with a conscious choice to use drugs, but addiction is not just "a lot of drug use." Recent scientific research provides overwhelming evidence that not only do drugs interfere with normal brain functioning creating powerful feelings of pleasure, but they also have long-term effects on brain metabolism and activity. At some point, changes occur in the brain that can turn drug abuse into addiction. Those addicted to drugs suffer from a compulsive drug craving and usage and cannot quit by themselves.
Job accommodations may include the use of paid or unpaid leave for inpatient medical treatment or flexible scheduling for counseling or to attend support meetings. When, as a part of a job, an individual is exposed to drugs in the workplace (e.g., hospitals, pharmacies), an employer may need to implement additional workplace supports, provide extra supervision, or reassign an individual to a position that does not involve exposure to drugs. JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations.
How can you tell if an employee is addicted to drugs?
The following are some of the behavioral characteristics that may occur with drug addiction. Note that these behavioral characteristics do not always indicate drug addiction, but may warrant further investigation.
            * Absences without notification and an excessive use of sick days
            * Frequent disappearances from the work site, long unexplained absences, improbable excuses
            * Unreliability in keeping appointments and meeting deadlines
            * Work performance that alternates between periods of high and low productivity
            * Mistakes made due to inattention, poor judgment, and bad decisions
            * Confusion, memory loss, and difficulty concentrating or recalling details and instructions
            * Ordinary tasks require greater effort and consume more time
            * Interpersonal relations with coworkers suffer
            * Rarely admits errors or accepts blame for errors or oversights
            * Progressive deterioration in personal appearance and hygiene
            * Wearing long sleeves when inappropriate
            * A personality change that includes mood swings, anxiety, depression, lack of impulse control, suicidal thoughts or gestures
            * Increasing personal and professional isolation
Can drug addiction be treated?
Yes. A variety of approaches are used in treatment programs to help patients deal with cravings and possibly avoid drug relapse. Through treatment that is tailored to individual needs, individuals can learn to control their condition. There are several types of drug abuse treatment programs. Short-term methods last less than six months and include residential therapy, medication therapy, and drug-free outpatient therapy. Longer term treatment may include, for example, methadone maintenance outpatient treatment for opiate addicts and residential therapeutic community treatment.
Drug Addiction and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
The following information is from Chapter VIII of the Title I Technical Assistance Manual:
Current illegal users of drugs are not "individuals with disabilities" under the ADA when an employer acts on the basis of such use. However, persons addicted to drugs but who are no longer using drugs illegally and are receiving treatment for drug addiction or who have been rehabilitated successfully are protected by the ADA from discrimination on the basis of past drug addiction.
A person who casually used illegal drugs in the past but did not become addicted is not an individual with a disability based on the past drug use. For a person to be "substantially limited" because of drug use, s/he must be addicted to the drug.
Individuals who are not illegally using drugs but who are erroneously perceived as being addicts and as currently using drugs illegally are protected by the ADA.
What does “illegal” drug use mean?
The illegal use of drugs includes the use, possession, or distribution of drugs that are unlawful under the Controlled Substances Act. It includes the use of illegal drugs and the illegal use of prescription drugs that are "controlled substances."
What does “current” illegal drug use mean?
"Current" drug use means that the illegal use of drugs occurred recently enough to justify an employer's reasonable belief that involvement with drugs is an ongoing problem. It is not limited to the day of use or recent weeks or days in terms of an employment action. It is determined on a case-by-case basis.
Are tests for illegal drugs considered medical tests under the ADA?
No. Drug tests are not considered medical examinations, and an applicant can be required to take a drug test before a conditional offer of employment has been made. An employee also can be required to take a drug test, whether or not such a test is job-related and necessary for the business. (On the other hand, a test to determine an individual's blood alcohol level would be a "medical examination" and only could be required by an employer in conformity with the ADA.)
While an employer may conduct tests to detect illegal use of drugs, the ADA does not prohibit, require, or encourage drug tests. Employers may comply with applicable Federal, State, or local laws regulating when and how drug tests may be used, what drug tests may be used, and confidentiality.
If a test for illegal drugs is given to a job applicant before a job offer is made, what happens if that drug test reveals the presence of legally prescribed drugs?
If a person is excluded from a job because the employer erroneously "regarded" him/her to be an addict currently using drugs illegally when a drug test revealed the presence of a lawfully prescribed drug, the employer would be liable under the ADA. To avoid such potential liability, the employer would have to determine whether the individual was using a legally prescribed drug. Because the employer may not ask what prescription drugs an individual is taking before making a conditional job offer, one way to avoid liability is to conduct drug tests after making an offer, even though such tests may be given at any time under the ADA. Because applicants who test positive for illegal drugs are not covered by the ADA, an employer can withdraw an offer of employment on the basis of illegal drug use.
If the results of a drug test indicate the presence of a lawfully prescribed drug, such information must be kept confidential in the same way as any medical record. If the results reveal information about a disability in addition to information about drug use, the disability-related information is to be treated as a confidential medical record.
Can an employer refuse to hire an applicant who has a history of illegal drug use?
Yes, in some situations. An employer can refuse to hire a person with a past history of illegal drug use, even if the person no longer uses drugs, in specific occupations, such as law enforcement, when an employer can show that this policy is job-related and consistent with business necessity.
An employer also may refuse to hire an individual with a history of illegal drug use if the employer can demonstrate that the individual poses a "direct threat" to health or safety because of the high probability that s/he would return to the illegal drug use. The employer must be able to demonstrate that such use would result in a high probability of substantial harm to the individual or others that could not be reduced or eliminated with a reasonable accommodation. Examples of accommodations in such cases might be to require periodic drug tests, to modify job duties, or to provide increased supervision.
Does the ADA restrict workplace programs to combat the use of drugs?
No. The ADA does not interfere with programs to combat the use of drugs in the workplace. The Act specifically provides that an employer may prohibit the use of drugs in the workplace and require that employees not be under the influence of drugs in the workplace.
Accommodating Employees with Drug Addiction
People with drug addiction may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people who are addicted to drugs will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
            1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
            2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
            3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
            4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
            5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
            6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Dystonia
The term dystonia refers to movement disorders characterized by involuntary muscle contractions causing abnormal, often painful, movements or postures. Any part of the body can be affected including the arms, legs, neck, trunk, eyelids, face, or vocal cords. Dystonia can be diagnosed in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. There are several classifications of dystonias based on the body parts affected. For example, generalized dystonia affects most or all of the body. Focal dystonia is localized to a specific part of the body. Multifocal dystonia involves two or more unrelated body parts. Segmental dystonia affects two or more adjacent parts of the body.
Hemidystonia involves the arm and leg on the same side of the body. Cervical dystonia is the most common of the focal dystonias and is sometimes referred to as spasmodic torticollis. The neck muscles that control the position of the head are affected resulting in pulling the head forward or backward or twisting from side to side. Blepharospasm, the second most common form of focal dystonia results in closure of the eyelids or rapid eye blinking causing vision problems. Cranial dystonia affects the muscles of the head, face, and neck. Spasmotic dystonia affects the muscles of the throat causing speech difficulty. Oromandibular dystonia causes speech and swallowing difficulties because the muscles of the jaw, lips, and tongue are affected. Writer’s cramp is a form of dystonia many people have experienced temporarily. Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) manifests symptoms in childhood or adolescence and affects walking with progression worsening during the day.
Dystonia and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment.

About Eating Disorders
A significant number of men and women experience eating disorders at some time during their lives. Many cases are probably not reported. Many more people may not meet the criteria for an eating disorder diagnosis, but have difficulty around dissatisfaction with their bodies and distorted beliefs and behaviors about eating. Eating disorders are characterized by a continual disturbance of eating or eating-related behavior that results in changes in eating patterns that significantly impairs physical and mental health. Although there are many eating disorders, JAN hears about those that are most prevalent:
            * Anorexia nervosa is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder characterized by restriction of energy intake (food consumption) and excessive weight loss. Symptoms include resistance to maintaining body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height; intense fear of weight gain; disturbance in the experience of body weight or shape; undue influence of weight or shape on self-evaluation, or denial of the seriousness of low body weight; and loss of menstrual periods in girls and women post-puberty.  Anorexia nervosa typically appears in early to mid-adolescence and it has one of the highest death rates of any mental health condition.
            * Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is a new diagnosis in the DSM-5, and represents a reformulation of what used to be called "Feeding Disorder of Infancy or Early Childhood." Individuals with ARFID limit the volume and/or variety of foods they consume, but unlike the other eating disorders, food avoidance or restriction is not related to fears of fatness or distress about body shape, size or weight. Instead, in ARFID, selective eating is motivated by a lack of interest in eating or food, sensory sensitivity (e.g., strong reactions to taste, texture, smell of foods), and/or a fear of aversive consequences (e.g., of choking or vomiting).
            * Binge eating disorder (BED) is a type of eating disorder not otherwise specified and is characterized by recurrent binge eating without the regular use of compensatory measures to counter the binge eating. It is characterized by frequent episodes of eating large quantities of food in short periods of time; feeling out of control over eating behavior during the episode; and feeling depressed, guilty, or disgusted by the behavior. Behavioral indicators of BED include eating when not hungry, eating alone because of embarrassment over quantities consumed and eating until uncomfortably full. BED is often associated with symptoms of depression.
            * Bulimia nervosa is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder characterized by a cycle of bingeing and compensatory behaviors designed to undo or compensate for the effects of binge eating. Its presence is indicated by regular intake of large amounts of food accompanied by a sense of loss of control over eating behavior; regular use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting, laxative or diuretic abuse, fasting, and/or obsessive or compulsive exercise; and extreme concern with body weight and shape. Bulimia nervosa is frequently associated with symptoms of depression and changes in social adjustment.
JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations. 
Eating Disorders and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Eating Disorders
People with eating disorders may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with eating disorders will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
            1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
            2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
            3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
            4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
            5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
            6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations:
Malnutrition: For individuals with eating disorders, having accommodations to help manage malnutrition can be helpful.

About Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects connective tissues and results in flexible joints, elastic skin, and fragile tissues. There are several variations of the syndrome with each affecting a different gene and producing different signs and symptoms. Joint hypermobility is the dominant clinical manifestation. Some types of EDS are characterized by weaknesses in the walls of the hollow organs of the gastrointestinal tract, in the esophagus, the cardiovascular system, specifically the heart and aorta,  uterus, large intestines, bladder, blood vessels, and the arteries. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can alter the body's response to injury. Complications such as joint dislocations, early-onset arthritis, damaged skin, and internal bleeding can result. Although there is no cure for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, injuries can be treated and preventative measure can be taken to mitigate chances of injury. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a lifelong condition and for those working, accommodations may be needed.
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and the Americans with Disabilities Act

About Electrical Sensitivity
There are people who report a sensitivity to electromagnetic fields. Although it has been difficult for the environmental health and medical communities to define, individuals with electromagnetic sensitivity report various symptoms including but not limited to fatigue, weakness, neurological issues, immunological issues, gastrointestinal issues, increased irritability, lack of ability to think clearly and quickly, sleep disturbance, overall malaise, and anxiety. Despite the medical community's difficulty in defining electromagnetic sensitivity, individuals with the condition may benefit from job accommodations.
Electrical Sensitivity and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Electrical Sensitivity
People with electrical/electromagnetic sensitivity may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with electrical/electromagnetic sensitivity will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
            1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
            2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
            3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
            4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
            5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
            6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations:
            * Allow communication via typewriter or handwritten notes rather than via computer or work with the employee to determine what modifications would allow them to use a computer safely and effectively.
            * Provide headset/handset extenders or alternate headsets to lengthen the distance between devices that trigger symptoms and the employee's body
            * Change the employee's shift to allow for less exposure to others' devices
            * Relocate workplace away from areas where symptoms are triggered.  This may include limiting certain types of devices in the vicinity of the employee's workstation
            * Allow telework 
            * Allow the employee to meet with others in areas where triggers are minimized or allow remote access to meetings or activities that must take place in areas that trigger symptoms.
            * Provide wired telephones and network connections
            * Provide building-wide and/or workspace shielding of equipment and devices, for example add filters to fluorescent lights and tape electrical cords

About Endometriosis
Endometriosis is a systemic disease in which tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, causing widespread inflammation and pain. These growths, known as implants or endometriomas, respond to hormonal changes and can lead to scarring, organ dysfunction, infertility, and severe physical and psychological distress. Endometriosis is typically found in the pelvic cavity, affecting reproductive organs like the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, as well as nearby structures such as the bladder, bowel, and pelvic nerves. It can spread beyond the pelvis to organs like the lungs, diaphragm, kidneys, or even the brain. While treatable, endometriosis has no known cause or cure.
Endometriosis affects roughly 10% of females globally (World Health Organization). Each person’s experience with endometriosis is different. Common symptoms or limitations include: 
            * Painful menstrual cramps
            * Abnormal, irregular, and heavy periods
            * Gastrointestinal issues (e.g., diarrhea or constipation)
            * Fatigue or low energy
            * Neuropathy
            * Infertility

Endometriosis and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Endometriosis
Employees with endometriosis may experience some, all, or none of the limitations included below. Other limitations may exist. Also, the degree of limitations will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with endometriosis will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
               1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
               2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
               3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
               4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
               5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
               6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations:
Pain: Endometriosis can cause chronic pelvic and back pain, painful menstrual cramps, and pain with bowel movements and urination. The pain often follows a cyclical pattern, intensifying during menstruation, but it can also occur at other times throughout the cycle.
               * Allow modified, flexible, or reduced scheduling and/or intermittent leave when experiencing pain and/or heavy bleeding, and to attend medical appointments 
               * Allow breaks as needed to move around, sit, stand, lie down, or relieve pain 
               * Provide or allow use of a heating pad, if needed
               * Provide adjustable seating with cushioning to reduce pain and pressure
               * Provide a workstation that allows the option to sit and stand while working
               * Limit long meetings/calls and/or allow to attend virtually
               * Allow work from home (this accommodation can enable employee to address various needs related to pain, discomfort, hygiene, gastrointestinal needs, eliminating commute, etc.)
               * When pain is exacerbated by lifting, reaching, pushing, and pulling, limit these duties by job restructuring (e.g., reallocate marginal tasks, provide help moving objects, or organize items in a way that reduces the need to move, lift, reach, push, pull items)
               * Limit walking distances to access restroom, break rooms, etc.
               * Provide parking accommodations
Gastrointestinal and Hygiene Needs: Endometriosis can cause abnormal, irregular, and heavy periods, and gastrointestinal issues, like diarrhea, constipation, and urgency.
               * Allow modified, flexible, or reduced scheduling and/or intermittent leave when experiencing heavy bleeding or gastrointestinal symptoms and discomfort
               * Allow breaks as needed to use the restroom and address hygiene needs
               * Provide closer access to a restroom
               * Provide a private area where hygiene needs can be addressed, such as a changing room
               * Don't require the employee to request to use the restroom (dignity issue)
               * Allow work from home (this accommodation can enable the employee to address various needs related to pain, discomfort, hygiene, gastrointestinal needs, etc.)
Decreased Stamina/Fatigue or Low Energy: Decreased stamina/fatigue and low energy can make it difficult for employees with endometriosis to perform physical work tasks and/or work extended hours. Rotating shifts and overtime can be problematic.
               * Allow breaks as needed 
               * Reduce or eliminate strenuous activities by restructuring job
               * Limit walking distances to access restrooms, break rooms, etc.
               * Provide anti-fatigue mats or padded carpeting
               * Provide a comfortable rest area
               * Allow flexibility to sit or stand
               * Allow job sharing
               * Allow a modified, flexible, or reduced schedule and/or intermittent leave as needed
               * Allow work from home to reserve energy
               * Provide parking accommodations
Cognitive Limitations: People with endometriosis may have difficulty concentrating and focusing due to pain and discomfort. JAN offers accommodation solutions to address various executive functioning deficits. These examples may help address difficulty concentrating:
               * Provide written job instructions and prioritize assignments
               * Increase job structure
               * Break large tasks into smaller, manageable steps
               * Use a daily planner or electronic organizer
               * Provide task reminders
               * Allow task prioritization flexibility and/or extend deadlines

               * Allow employee to block-off uninterrupted work time
               * Minimize audible and visual distractions in the work area
Stress: Stress can worsen endometriosis symptoms, including pain and fatigue, by increasing inflammation and pain sensitivity. Accommodations may help reduce stress.
               * Allow flexible, modified, or reduced scheduling 
               * Allow breaks as needed for de-escalation
               * Reallocate marginal duties that cause undue stress by job restructuring

About Epilepsy/Seizure Disorder
Epilepsy is the tendency to have repeated seizures that originate in the brain. There are several types of possible seizures that range from losing consciousness and massive muscles jerks to blank stares. For example, generalized tonic clonic seizures, also called grand mal seizures, look like the individual suddenly cries or falls; the individual may lose consciousness. On the other hand, generalized absence seizures or petit mal seizures look like a blank stare, beginning and ending abruptly, lasting only a few seconds.
JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations. 
Plan of Action:
In the event that a seizure does occur in the workplace, it is wise to be prepared. Preparation begins with a plan of action.
Can you remember back to elementary school? Think back to practice for a fire drill. Everyone in the entire school knew the plan and was prepared for the fire drill. Everyone knew who was in charge, what responsibilities each person had, how quickly to respond to an alarm, and how to exit the building. That type of preparedness made the fire drill work efficiently.
A plan of action is very similar to an elementary school fire drill. A plan of action is an emergency preparedness tool. It can be used to prepare for, or respond to, emergency situations that arise when a person has a seizure on the job. A plan of action can be created with the employee and employer and can include information such as:
               * emergency contact information
               * visual or audible warning signs
               * how/when to provide on-site medical assistance
               * how/when to call 9-1-1
               * how to provide environmental support
               * who to designate as emergency responders
               * who to go to for help
               * how to educate co-workers about epilepsy
A properly implemented plan of action may reduce the confusion, panic, or fear that co-workers or customers experience if they see an employee having a seizure on the job. When the plan of action is “in action,” one designated person calls a spouse or emergency contact. One designated person watches over the employee. No one provides incorrect or unnecessary medical assistance (CPR, for example). No one overreacts to the emergency because everyone is prepared for it, can identify it, and respond appropriately to it.
A sample plan of action is provided. Please use it as guidance on how to write a plan of action. Employers are not required by the ADA to use the following form, nor are employees with epilepsy required by the ADA to use the form.
Sample Plan of Action
________________


Warning Signs for Oncoming Seizure:
 
               1. John will experience nausea.
               2. John’s face or shoulder/arm will jerk involuntarily.
               3. Warning signs give John 3-4 minutes before seizure activity begins.
               4. John will signal designated co-worker using 2-way radio (with texting) to inform of oncoming seizure.
Action Plan:
 
               1. Using his hand or arm, gently lead John to designated safe area.
               2. If necessary, help John into a seated or laying position.
               3. If necessary, loosen any restrictive clothing (such as a tie or scarf).
               4. During seizure (which lasts from 2 - 5 minutes), John will not need medical attention.
               5. When seizure subsides, offer John a cool cloth for his face or a cool drink.
               6. If John is disoriented, identify yourself and identify his location/surroundings.
Additional Comments:
 
               1. Two designated co-workers will carry radios to hear John’s emergency signal.
               2. Supervisor will call John’s emergency contact person.
               3. Based upon John’s documentation provided by his neurologist, ambulance/medical attention is not required unless John falls or hits his head.
Epilepsy/Seizure Disorder and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Epilepsy/Seizure Disorder
People with epilepsy may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with epilepsy will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
               1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
               2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
               3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
               4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
               5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
               6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations:
Accommodation Ideas for Cognitive Impairments Associated with Epilepsy
Memory Loss:
Individuals with various disability types may experience memory deficits that can affect their ability to complete tasks, remember job duties, or recall daily actions or activities. Memory difficulties may be a limitation related to the condition itself, a side effect of medication, or only manifest periodically for episodic conditions. Accommodation ideas usually involve modifying the way one obtains, retains, and retrieves information.
Memory Loss Accommodations Continued:
               * Provide a voice-activated recorder to record verbal instructions
               * Provide written information and instructions
               * Post written or pictorial instructions on frequently used machines or for routine procedures
               * Provide templates or forms to prompt for needed information
               * Provide employee directory with pictures or use nametags and door/cubicle name markers to help employee remember coworkers' faces and names
               * Provide reminders of important deadlines via emails, memos, and weekly supervision
               * Provide printed minutes of meetings and trainings
               * Use sticky notes as reminders of important dates or tasks
               * Provide checklists
               * Prompt employee with verbal cues (reminders)
               * Encourage employee to ask (or email) work-related questions
               * Remove marginal job functions to allow more focus on essential functions
               * Use color-coding to indicate important information
               * Use a daily or weekly task list
               * Extend training time and training refreshers when significant workplace changes occur
               * Use a wall calendar or planner
               * Use notebooks or sticky notes to record information for easy retrieval
               * Use electronic organizers, hand held devices, and/or apps
               * Use a flowchart to describe the steps involved in a complicated task (such as powering up a system, closing down the facility, logging into a computer, etc.)
               * Provide a mentor for daily guidance
               * Safely and securely maintain paper lists of crucial information such as passwords
 
Time Management: Individuals with epilepsy may have difficulty managing time, which can affect their ability to complete tasks within a specified timeframe. It may also be difficult to prepare for, or to begin, some work activities.
               * Divide large assignments into several small tasks
               * Set a timer to make an alarm  
               * Provide a checklist of assignments
               * Supply an electronic or handheld organizer and train on how to use effectively
               * Use a wall calendar to emphasize due dates
               * Make daily to-do lists and check items off as completed
Stress Management: Individuals with epilepsy may have seizures when stress is not properly managed. Situations that create stress can vary from person to person, but could likely involve heavy workload, unrealistic timeframes, shortened deadlines, or conflict among coworkers.
               * Provide praise and positive reinforcement
               * Refer to employee assistance programs

               * Telework or hybrid telework
Accommodation Ideas for Sensory Impairments Associated with Seizures
Photosensitivity: Individuals with epilepsy may have seizures or headaches due to light sensitivity, which can be exacerbated by light sources such as computer screens or fluorescent lights.
               * Use a flicker-free monitor (LCD display, flat screen)
               * Use a monitor glare guard
               * Use a cubicle shield
               * Allow frequent breaks from tasks involving computer
               * Provide alternative light sources:
               * Replace fluorescent lights with full-spectrum lighting
               * Use natural lighting source (window) instead of electric light
               * Provide fluorescent light tube covers
               * Allow use of light filtering lenses
               * Schedule periodic breaks from computer usage
Seeing/Hearing/Communicating: During or after seizures, an employee may temporarily have limited ability to see, hear, or speak.
               * Allow the employee time to recuperate from a seizure
               * Identify hand signals or other universal signals that the employee might use to communicate with another person
               * Use PECS (picture exchange communication system) to communicate
               * Use paging systems to communicate with coworkers
               * Provide 2-way radios with texting options

Other Accommodations
Ensuring Safety in the Workplace: Take some universal precautions to ensure safety in the workplace.
               * Designate a person to respond to emergencies
               * Keep aisles clear of clutter
               * Provide a quick, unobstructed exit
               * Post clearly marked directions for exits, fire doors, etc.
               * Know when to (or not to) call 9-1-1
               * Consult employee’s plan of action to determine how to respond/react when employee has a seizure on the job (see "Plan of Action" section for additional information)
Attendance/Absenteeism: Seizure activity can affect a person’s attendance at work.
               * Allow employee to remain on the job after a seizure when possible
               * Provide a flexible schedule
               * Modify an attendance policy
               * Provide leave while the employee is adjusting to medications
               * Allow a straight shift instead of rotating shifts
Personal Care: During or after a seizure, people with epilepsy may exhibit behaviors such as crying, drooling, spitting, or urinating. As a result, the person may need time following a seizure to engage in activities of daily living such as grooming and changing clothes.
               * Allow the employee to keep a change of clothes at the workplace
               * Provide a private space to regain composure and perform self-care tasks
               * Provide sensitivity training/disability awareness to coworkers
Driving: People with epilepsy may have driving restrictions. For specific information about a state’s regulations involving driving with epilepsy, see Epilepsy Foundation: State Driving Laws Database:
Pair the employee with a co-worker who can drive to meetings or events
               * Allow telework or work from home
               * Transfer the employee to a position that does not require driving
               * Adjust schedule so the employee can access public transportation

About Essential Tremors
Essential tremor is a nerve disorder in which tremors (shakes) occur without an identifiable cause when a person is moving or trying to move. Essential tremor of the hands typically occurs when the hands are in use. In contrast, tremors from Parkinson's are most prominent when a person's hands are at his sides or resting in his lap. Essential tremor can involve your hands, head and voice.
Essential tremor is the most common form of abnormal tremor. It resembles an exaggerated shaking. Essential tremor is a relatively benign condition, affecting movement or voice quality, but with no other effects. It involves a rhythmic, moderately rapid tremor of voluntary muscles. Purposeful movements may make the tremors worse, while avoiding hand movements may suppress the tremors completely. There may be difficulty holding or using small objects (such as silverware or writing utensils).
In the workplace, people with essential tremor may have difficulty writing, keyboarding and mousing, grasping small tools or items, and communicating. Limitations may be worsened by fatigue, stress and anxiety, and temperature extremes.
Essential Tremors and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Essential Tremors
People with essential tremors may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with essential tremors will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
               1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
               2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
               3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
               4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
               5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
               6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a common, yet preventable condition that results from prenatal alcohol exposure. The impairments that are part of fetal alcohol syndrome are irreversible and can include serious physical, mental, and behavioral problems with possible life-long implications. The severity of the impairments varies, with some individuals experiencing them to a far greater degree than others. As many as 40,000 babies are born with some type of alcohol-related impairment each year in the United States.
FAS is not a single birth defect; it is a cluster of related problems, the most severe of a group of consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure. Collectively, the range of disorders is known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Signs of FAS may include distinctive facial features; heart, kidney, and bone defects; slow physical growth before and after birth; vision and/or hearing difficulties; small head circumference and brain size; poor coordination; sleep problems; intellectual impairments, delayed development, and learning disorders. Behavioral issues associated with FAS include short attention span; hyperactivity; extreme nervousness and anxiety; and poor impulse control, reasoning, and judgment skills.
JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations. 
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
People with FAS may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with FAS will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
               1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
               2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
               3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
               4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
               5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
               6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Fibromyalgia
Fibromyalgia is a complex, chronic condition that causes widespread pain and severe fatigue. Fibromyalgia is often considered a syndrome because it is a set of signs and symptoms that occur together, affecting nerves, muscles and their attachments to bones. It is not a true form of arthritis and does not cause deformities of the joints. It is, however, a form of soft tissue or muscular rheumatism. Deep muscular pain is the most common symptom of fibromyalgia. Usually starting at the neck and shoulders and spreading to other parts of the body over time, the pain varies according to the time of day, weather, sleep patterns, and stress level.
People with fibromyalgia experience extreme tenderness when pressure is applied to the knees, thighs, hips, elbows, and neck. People with fibromyalgia are also likely to have sleep disorders; severe changes in mood and thinking, including depression and chronic anxiety; headaches; impaired memory; irritable bowel syndrome; multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome; restless legs; skin and temperature sensitivity; and tingling similar to the symptoms of cumulative trauma disorders.
JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations. 
Fibromyalgia and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Fibromyalgia
People with fibromyalgia may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with fibromyalgia will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.


Questions to Consider:
               1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
               2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
               3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
               4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
               5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
               6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Food Allergy
A food allergy occurs when a person’s immune system decides that a particular food is harmful and so creates specific antibodies to it. The next time the individual is exposed to that food, the immune system releases massive amounts of chemicals to protect the body. These chemicals trigger a cascade of allergic symptoms that can affect the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, skin, or cardiovascular system. Symptoms range from a tingling sensation in the mouth, swelling of the tongue and the throat, difficulty breathing, hives, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, drop in blood pressure, and loss of consciousness to death. Symptoms typically appear within minutes to two hours after the person has eaten the food to which he or she is allergic.
Although a person can be allergic to any food, there are eight foods that account for most of all food allergy reactions. These are milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat. Currently, there are no medications that cure food allergies. Strict avoidance of the allergy-causing food is the only way to avoid a reaction.
Food Allergy and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Food Allergy
People with food allergies may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with food allergy will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
General Accommodation Considerations
Implement a Policy Restricting Certain Foods from the Workplace
Note: While implementing policies restricting certain foods is not fail-safe, it may help to reduce exposure.
               * Post signs at entrances to the building and in hallways, restrooms, waiting rooms, classrooms, and cafeterias alerting people that certain foods are restricted due to a severe food allergy.
               * Send memos to employees mentioning that if a person has eaten the offending food to let others know so the proper precautions may be taken. Some allergic reactions have occurred when a person has contact with someone who has eaten an offending food.
               * Send occasional memos encouraging compliance with the policy.
               * Enforce the policy with consequences for violations.
Sample Policy Language
               * Memo to staff: "You may have noticed the signs up on the front door stating that this is a peanut and tree nut-free workplace. Please cooperate with this request because there are several of us on staff who are sensitive to peanuts and tree nuts to varying degrees. Our bodies have a hard time when we come into contact with these foods, and they may even cause anaphylaxis or death. If you have consumed peanuts, tree nuts, or other foods containing these products, please let [the receptionist, the manager, the HR person, etc.] know so we can take appropriate precautions."
               * Sign posted at business entrance: "This is a peanut and tree nut-free office. Please help us to accommodate our co-workers and clients who are allergic to these foods. Thank you for not bringing these items into the workplace."
Modify Workplace Policies
               * Allow employee to eat at his/her desk or in his/her office or allow extra time during lunch so the employee may go home to eat.
               * Permit flexible scheduling so the employee with a food allergy may work when less people are present in the workplace to decrease possible exposure.
               * Relocate employee’s workspace to reduce possibility of exposure to offending foods.
Traveling for Work
               * Research current airline policies regarding snacks served on the plane; some airlines do not serve peanut snacks.
               * Allow employees who travel for work to stay overnight in hotels with refrigerators in the rooms so they may bring their own food.
Recurrent Need for Medical Intervention 
               * Permit flexible scheduling.
               * Allow a self-paced workload with flexible hours.
               * Provide time off for medical appointments.
               * Consider work from home.
               * Allow additional unpaid leave if employee exhausts accrued time off.
Create an Emergency Plan of Action
               * Conduct a training session to educate employees on food allergies.
               * Discuss the proper steps to take in an emergency situation, e.g., how to call 911.
               * Discuss the signs and symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction, which may include a tingling sensation in the mouth, swelling of the tongue and the throat, difficulty breathing, hives, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, dizziness, and loss of consciousness.
               * Allow an employee to keep medication with him/her at all times.
               * Note that an employee with a food allergy may wear a medical alert necklace or bracelet.
Questions to Consider:
               1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
               2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
               3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
               4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
               5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
               6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Fragrance Sensitivity
Fragrance sensitivity is either an irritation or an allergic reaction to some chemical, or combination of chemicals, in a product. Although perfumes and colognes are generally what come to mind when discussing fragrance sensitivity, fragrance is often added to a variety of daily use items including but not limited to toiletries, cosmetics, air fresheners, cleaning products, and pesticides. Ingredients used in fragrance are not required to be disclosed on labels, which can make it difficult to identify the ingredient or product that is responsible for the sensitivity. Regardless of what the specific allergen is or whether it has been identified, common reactions to exposure include headaches, respiratory problems, asthma, and skin irritations. 
There are two types of allergy symptoms due to fragrance sensitivity - respiratory or skin allergy symptoms. Symptoms of fragrance sensitivity can include headaches, nausea, and a skin allergy like contact dermatitis, which causes redness, itching, and burning. Watery, itching, burning, and red eyes; sneezing; runny nose; and congestion are also common. In some cases, individuals experience breathing difficulties, such as wheezing, a tight feeling in the chest, or worsening of asthma symptoms. Frequency and level of sensitivity can differ from one individual to another and identifying the exact cause of the irritation or allergy can be difficult because of the complex chemical formulas in many everyday use products. 
The potential for exposure can be high as fragrances are added to of everyday products, and there has been an increase in the amount of time spent in indoor environments. Those with asthma, allergies, or other respiratory disorders may be more susceptible to the effects of fragranced products. The best way to prevent fragrance sensitivity is to remove, block, or avoid the offending substance. Discussing the fragrance sensitivity with people at work and at home also can also help to limit exposure to other people's fragrances.
Because there is no requirement for manufacturers to list all the ingredients in their products, finding a product that is truly fragrance free can be challenging. Even some products that are labeled as being "unscented" or "fragrance free" contain herbal ingredients or oils from botanicals. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Design for the Environment (DfE) program helps identify cleaning and other products that have been determined to be effective and safer for human health and the environment. These products carry the Dfe label and a list of all partners and products recognized under the DfE Safer Product Labeling Program. 
When dealing with fragrance sensitivity, there are really three main options to consider as accommodations:
1) Remove the offending fragrances.
When possible, an employer should try to remove the offending fragrance, especially if the fragrance is unique to the work environment, minimal, and/or the employer has more control over it. However, as mentioned earlier, under the ADA it is probably not reasonable for an employer to have and enforce a total no-fragrance policy because it is difficult if not impossible to enforce, especially if non-employees such as clients and volunteers come into the workplace.   
 
2) Remove the employee from the area where the fragrances are located.
When it is not possible to remove the offending fragrance, an employer may be able to move the employee away from the fragrance. This usually means working at home or in a private office with no exposure to coworkers, clients, or other members of the public. Regarding work at home, unless the employee wants to work at home, other options should be explored first to keep the employee in the workplace.
3) Reduce the employee's exposure to the fragrances.
If the offending fragrance cannot be removed and the employee cannot be moved completely away from the fragrance, it may be possible to reduce the employee's exposure to an acceptable level. This usually means a private office with its own ventilation and minimum exposure to others. It can also mean allowing the individual to wear a mask or respirator. Some individuals are able to wear masks/respirators while others are not or may not be comfortable wearing them. Employers should keep in mind that they cannot force an employee to use a mask/respirator.
Sample Policy Language:
The following are examples of fragrance-free workplace policy statements.
               * Anonymous City Law Enforcement Agency Policy: "To reasonably accommodate bureau employees who have written memoranda documenting chemical sensitivity to perfume, employees will wear no perfume or cologne during business hours when they are scheduled to be within the bureau during their shift. This policy will not affect those bureau employees who are in an off-site training class, on city business, or out of the office for an entire shift."
               * Anonymous Employer: "(Name of employer) strives to ensure the comfort and safety of staff and visitors by encouraging a smoke free and fragrance free environment."
               * Anonymous State Community Development Agency, Employee Administrative Bulletin: "Given that chemically sensitive individuals may react to different products with widely varying degrees of severity, it is very difficult to ensure a consistently comfortable and accommodating work environment under every conceivable set of circumstances. Even so, it is the general consensus of the Labor/Management Committee and the desire of the (company name) to minimize to the extent possible the barriers and difficulties experienced in the workplace by both employees and clients subject to chemical/fragrance sensitivities. The (company name) requests that all offices and spaces used by the staff and their visitors remain free of chemical-based scented products."
               * Anonymous Employer, Staff Memo from Executive Director: "I ask that we refrain from applying spray colognes, hairsprays, and or air fresheners in the office, as the use of such products may trigger allergic reactions and create health problems."
               * Anonymous Employer, Administrative Manual Policy, Subject: Employee Appearance: "Cologne, perfume, aftershave lotions, scented lotions, or body washes are not to be worn in the Medical Center."
               * State Protection and Advocacy Agency: "This is a fragrance free office. Thank you for not wearing any of the following: cologne, after shave lotion, perfume, perfumed hand lotion, fragranced hair products, and/or similar products. Our chemically-sensitive co-workers and clients thank you."
               * Anonymous Employer: "This is a fragrance free office. Please help us to accommodate our co-workers and clients who are chemically sensitive to fragrances and other scented products. Thank you for not wearing perfume, aftershave, scented hand lotion, fragranced hair products, and or similar products."
               * Anonymous Employer, Memo to All Staff: "You may have noticed the signs up on the front door and on the library doors stating that this is a fragrance-free office. Please cooperate with this request because there are several of us on staff and visitors to our office who are chemically sensitive to varying degrees. Our bodies have a hard time when we come into contact with a variety of chemicals and each episode takes its toll on our bodies. Please use only unscented products during work hours. This does not include deodorant or bath soap at this time."
               * U.S. Access Board: "Under this policy, the Board requests that all participants refrain from wearing perfume, cologne, and other fragrances, and use unscented personal care products in order to promote a fragrance-free environment. This request is included in notices and on displayed signage for the Board's meetings, hearings, and other public events. In addition, the Board will work with the operators of meeting sites to prevent the use of deodorizers and cleaning products immediately before the event in and around meeting locations."

Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment.

About Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD, Acid Reflux, Heartburn)
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a digestive disorder that affects the lower esophageal sphincter (LES)--the muscle connecting the esophagus with the stomach. Gastroesophageal refers to the stomach and esophagus. Reflux means to flow back or return; gastroesophageal reflux is the return of the stomach's contents back up into the esophagus. Many people have from heartburn or acid indigestion caused by GERD, and some people have GERD symptoms due to a hiatal hernia. In most cases, heartburn can be relieved through diet and lifestyle changes; however, some people may require medication or surgery.
Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD, Acid Reflux, Heartburn) and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD, Acid Reflux, Heartburn)
People with GERD may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with arthritis will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
               1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
               2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
               3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
               4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
               5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
               6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Gastrointestinal Disorders
Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders affect millions of people of all ages - men, women, and children. Examples of GI disorders include Crohn's disease, gastroparesis, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, spastic colon, and diverticulitis. Symptoms of GI disorders range from very mild to debilitating. Just as symptoms may vary from person to person, so may the need for job accommodation.

About Guillain Barre' Syndrome
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) can affect anybody but is rare, affecting only about one person in 100,000. The first symptoms of this disorder include varying degrees of weakness or tingling sensations in the legs, which can later spread to the arms and upper body. These symptoms can increase in intensity until certain muscles cannot be used at all and, when severe, the person is almost totally paralyzed. In these cases the disorder is life threatening and is considered a medical emergency. Most individuals, however, have good recovery from even the most severe cases of GBS, although some continue to have a certain degree of weakness.
Guillain Barre' Syndrome and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment.

About Hand Amputation
An individual may have use of one hand for a variety of reasons. It could be from an injury or amputation. It may also be from a repetitive stress injury like carpal tunnel or it could be congenital. For some jobs an individual may not need an accommodation. In others, modifications may be needed to make the individual more productive. 
 
Hand Amputation and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Hand Amputation
People with limitations from a hand amputation may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people who are aging will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                  1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                  2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                  3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                  4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                  5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                  6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Hearing Impairment
According to the National Association of the Deaf, the term “deaf” refers to individuals who are not able to hear well enough to rely on hearing as a means for processing information. The term “hard of hearing” refers to individuals who have some hearing loss but are able to use hearing to communicate. 
Hearing Impairment and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Hearing Impairment
People with hearing loss may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with hearing loss will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                  1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                  2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                  3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                  4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                  5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                  6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Heart Condition
The term “heart condition” includes conditions such as high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, and congenital cardiovascular impairments. Each type of heart condition has its own symptoms, which may include angina (chest pain sometimes radiating down the left arm or into the jaw); sensations of fluttering, thumping, pounding, or racing of the heart (palpitations); edema (swelling and fluid retention in the legs, ankles, abdomen, lungs, or heart); lightheadedness, weakness, dizziness, or fainting spells; breathlessness; chronic fatigue; and gastric upset (or nausea).
Heart Condition and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).

About Hepatitis
There are several types of hepatitis and each has different modes of transmission, symptoms, and treatment. The most prevalent types are hepatitis A, B, & C:
                  * Hepatitis A is the most common type of Hepatitis. It is a liver disease that occurs when infected by the Hepatitis A Virus (HAV). HAV is transmitted through a fecal-oral route either by person-to-person transmission between household contacts or sex partners or by ingesting contaminated food or water. Bloodbourne transmission is rare. Hepatitis A is highly contagious if you are in close personal contact with an infected individual. The CDC Department of Health and Human Services publishes a list of infectious and communicable diseases transmitted through handling the food supply. Pathogens that can cause disease after an infected person handles food include the hepatitis A virus. No other type of hepatitis can be transmitted through the food supply. Symptoms include fatigue, nausea, jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain.
                  * Hepatitis B is a serious disease caused by a virus that attacks the liver. The virus, which is called hepatitis B virus (HBV), can cause lifelong infection, cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, liver cancer, liver failure, and death. HBV is transmitted by contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. It is NOT spread through food, water, or by causal contact. Symptoms include jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting.
                  * Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV is transmitted by direct contact with infected blood. Symptoms include jaundice, fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and vomiting.
Hepatitis and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Hepatitis
People with hepatitis may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with hepatitis will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                  1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                  2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                  3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                  4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                  5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                  6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations
Fatigue/Weakness: Individuals with Hepatitis may experience decreased stamina or fatigue, making it challenging to perform physically demanding tasks or tolerate extended work hours.
                  * Flexible leave
                  * Modified schedule
                  * Consider access to the facility (ramps, parking, etc.)
                  * Frequent rest breaks
                  * Reduce or eliminate strenuous activity
                  * Flexibility to sit or stand (adjustable workstation)
                  * Provide a rest area with cot
                  * Job sharing
Cognitive Complications: Impaired cognitive function may result in memory loss, difficulty managing time, organizational limitations, and executive dysfunction.
                  * Provide written job instructions and prioritize assignments
                  * Increase job structure
                  * Use of day planner or electronic organizer
                  * Minimize distractions
Psychological Implications: Adjusting to having a disability, as well as the impact on one’s life may result in decreased tolerance for stressors in the workplace.
                  * Identify stressors and reduce stress
                  * Educate coworkers, but keep person and his/her condition confidential
                  * Allow telephone calls to emotional supports
                  * Open-door policy to supervisor
                  * Time off for counseling or therapy
                  * Provide praise and positive reinforcement
Other Considerations:
                  * Work from home options
                  * Reassignment. Reassignment is typically considered if the employee can no longer perform the essential functions of their job (either with or without accommodations).

About Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), the virus that causes AIDS, is a life-long disease that compromises the body’s immune system, making it difficult to fight-off illnesses and other diseases. HIV infection leads to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) when the CD4 cells, also known as T Cells, of the immune system are destroyed to the point where the body cannot fight off infections and diseases. AIDS in the final stage of HIV infection. Due to improved treatment, many individuals with HIV continue to work without needing any accommodations. 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
People with HIV/AIDS may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people who are aging will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                  1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                  2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                  3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                  4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                  5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                  6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Huntington's Disease
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a hereditary, degenerative brain disorder for which there is, at present, no treatment to slow the progression of symptoms and no cure. Most individuals with HD begin to exhibit symptoms between the ages of 30 to 50, and are likely to be employed when first diagnosed. As this genetic disease progresses, it will affect cognitive, motor, and behavioral functioning.
Motor issues often include involuntary movements, difficulty with speech and swallowing, lack of coordination, and fatigue and weakness. Many cognitive functions become limited, such as memory, decision making, critical thinking, multitasking and concentration. Behavioral issues include anxiety, depression, mood swings, and stress intolerance, as well as irritability and impulsivity.
Huntington's Disease and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Huntington's Disease
People with Huntington's disease may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with Huntington's disease will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                  1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                  2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                  3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                  4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                  5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                  6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Intellectual Disability
According to the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, an intellectual disability is a disability that involves significant limitations both in intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior. Adaptive behaviors include many everyday social and practical skills such as interpersonal and communication skills, social problem solving and responsibility, the use of time and money, as well as daily personal care and safety. Limitations in individuals often coexist with strengths, and will vary from individual to individual.
This disability originates before the age of 18 and encompasses a wide range of conditions, types, and levels. Intellectual disability is caused by factors that can be physical, genetic, and/or social. According to the President's Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities, an estimated seven to eight million Americans of all ages experience intellectual disability. Intellectual disabilities affect about one in ten families in the United States.
                  * JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations. 
                  * JAN's Effective Accommodation Practices (EAP) Series: Communication Tips for Working with Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities is a publication discussing strategies for communicating with individuals who process information more slowly. 
Additional Helpful Terminology
Developmental disabilities that may also include an intellectual disability are briefly described below. Intellectual disabilities can also be caused by a head injury, stroke or illness. For some no cause is found. Intellectual disabilities will vary in degree and effect from person to person, just as individual capabilities vary considerably among people who do not have an intellectual disability. People should not make generalizations about the needs of persons with intellectual disabilities. In some instances an intellectual disability will not be obvious from a person's appearance, nor will it be accompanied by a physical disability. Persons with intellectual disabilities successfully perform a wide range of jobs, and can be dependable workers. (EEOC, 2011)
Autism: Individuals with disabilities on the autism spectrum may have complex developmental disabilities that typically appear during the first three years of life. These disabilities are the result of a neurological disorder that affects the normal functioning of the brain, impacting development in the areas of social interaction and communication skills. Both children and adults with disabilities on the autism spectrum typically show difficulties in verbal and non-verbal communication, social interactions, and play or leisure activities. 
Cerebral Palsy is a condition, sometimes thought of as a group of disorders, that can involve brain and nervous system functions such as movement, learning, hearing, seeing, and thinking. Cerebral palsy is caused by injuries or abnormalities of the brain. Most of these problems occur as the baby grows in the womb, but they can happen at any time during the first two years of life, while the baby's brain is still developing. 
Down Syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes lifelong intellectual disabilities, developmental delays and other complications. Down syndrome varies in severity, so developmental problems range from moderate to serious. Down syndrome is the most common genetic cause of severe intellectual disabilities in children. Individuals with Down syndrome have a higher incidence of heart defects, leukemia, sleep apnea, and dementia later in life. 
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is a condition that results from prenatal alcohol exposure. It is a cluster of mental and physical birth defects that include intellectual disabilities, growth deficits, central nervous system dysfunction, craniofacial abnormalities and behavioral instabilities. Fetal Alcohol Effect is a less severe set of the same symptoms. It is the only form of intellectual disability that can be totally prevented and eradicated.
Fragile X Syndrome is a hereditary condition that can cause learning problems ranging from subtle learning disabilities and a normal IQ, to severe intellectual disabilities and autism. Individuals with Fragile X Syndrome may also have physical and behavioral disorders, and speech and language delays. 
Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is the most common known genetic cause of life-threatening obesity in children. PWS typically causes low muscle tone, short stature if not treated with growth hormone, and a chronic feeling of hunger that, coupled with a metabolism that utilizes drastically fewer calories than normal, can lead to excessive eating and life-threatening obesity. PWS is also characterized by motor development delays along with some behavior problems and unique medical issues. Intellectual deficits can be present to varying degrees, but even higher functioning individuals will have learning difficulties.
Intellectual Disability and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Intellectual Disability
People with intellectual or cognitive disabilities may develop some of the limitations discussed below but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with intellectual or cognitive disabilities will need accommodations to perform their jobs, and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                  1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                  2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                  3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                  4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                  5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                  6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Latex Allergy
Latex allergy is a reaction to proteins present in latex derived from natural rubber latex (NRL), which is created from a variety of plants, but mainly the rubber tree, hevea brasiliensis). Latex allergy can result from repeated exposures to proteins in NRL through skin contact or inhalation. Reactions usually begin within minutes of exposure to latex, but they can occur hours later and can produce various symptoms. These include skin rash and inflammation, respiratory irritation, asthma, and in rare cases shock. In some instances, sensitized employees have experienced reactions so severe that they impeded the worker’s ability to continue working in specific jobs. 
People at increased risk for developing latex allergy include workers with ongoing latex exposure, persons with a tendency to have multiple allergic conditions, and persons with spina bifida. Latex allergy is also associated with allergies to certain foods such as avocados, potatoes, bananas, tomatoes, chestnuts, kiwi fruit, and papaya. Workers who use gloves less frequently, such as law enforcement personnel, ambulance attendants, fire fighters, food service employees, painters, gardeners, housekeeping personnel outside the health-care industry, and funeral home employees, also may develop latex allergy. Workers in factories where NRL products are manufactured or used also may be affected. 
Latex Allergy and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment.

Accommodating Employees with Latex Allergy
People with latex allergies may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with latex allergies will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available, and numerous other accommodation solutions may exist:
                  * Discontinue the use of latex gloves. Purchase alternative glove products such as vinyl or nitrile. The feasibility of using alternatives will likely depend upon the infection control needed to perform job tasks.
                  * If latex gloves must be used, switch to non-powdered latex with reduced protein content. Provide all employees within the individual's working environment with non-powdered gloves as well. If other employees continue to wear powdered latex gloves, the latex proteins can become airborne and create the potential for an allergic reaction.
                  * If powdered latex gloves are used, thoroughly clean the environment to remove powder residue from walls, equipment and HVAC vents.
                  * Implement a latex-safe department, clinic or facility. Eliminate the use of latex gloves and, when possible, switch to non-latex medical supplies. If the entire facility cannot be latex-safe, safeguard specific locations by creating latex-safe zones.
                  * Place the individual in the least latex-intensive environment possible.
                  * If the individual cannot be accommodated in the original position because of the need to eliminate exposure to latex, investigate reassignment as an accommodation. When possible, place the individual in a position that continues to take advantage of the employee’s clinical or technical skills. For example, if a nurse can no longer perform duties involving direct patient care, consider positions that still require nursing skills. Opportunities may exist in case management, occupational health nursing, health hotlines, poison control, the insurance industry, medical mal-practice or teaching.
Questions to Consider:
                  1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                  2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                  3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                  4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                  5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                  6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Learning Disability
Learning disabilities refer to a number of disorders that may affect the acquisition, organization, retention, understanding or use of verbal or nonverbal information. These disorders affect learning in individuals who otherwise demonstrate at least average abilities essential for thinking and/or reasoning. Learning disabilities result from impairments in one or more processes related to perceiving, thinking, remembering or learning. Learning disabilities range in severity and may interfere with the acquisition and use of oral language, reading, written language, and mathematics. Learning disabilities may also involve difficulties with organizational skills and social interaction. 
Although learning disabilities occur in very young children, the disorders are usually not recognized until the child reaches school age. Learning disabilities are lifelong and are not outgrown or cured, though many people develop coping techniques through special education, tutoring, medication, therapy, personal development, or adaptation of learning skills.  Learning disabilities arise from neurological differences in brain structure and function and affect a person’s ability to receive, store, process, retrieve or communicate information. 
JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations. 
What types of learning disabilities are there?
Learning disabilities can be divided into three broad categories:
Specific Learning Disability: A disorder in understanding or in using language, spoken or written, which may manifest itself in an imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, write, spell or to do mathematical calculations. Included in this category are expressive writing and expressive language disorders.
                  * Dyslexia is the term associated with specific learning disabilities in reading. Although features of a learning disability in reading vary from person to person, common characteristics include the difficulty with individual sounds in words, and difficulties with word decoding, fluency, rate of reading, rhyming, spelling, vocabulary, comprehension and written expression. Dyslexia is the most prevalent and well-recognized of the subtypes of specific learning disabilities.
                  * Dyscalculia is the term associated with specific learning disabilities in math. Although features of a learning disability in math vary from person to person, common characteristics include difficulty with counting, learning number facts and doing math calculations, difficulty with measurement, telling time, counting money, estimating number quantities, mental math and problem-solving strategies.
                  * Dysgraphia is the term associated with specific learning disabilities in writing. This term is used to capture both the physical act of writing and the quality of written expression. Dysgraphia can manifest in difficulties with spelling, putting thoughts on paper, and poor handwriting, including difficulty in forming letters or writing within a defined space, organizing thoughts on paper, keeping track of thoughts already written down, and difficulty with syntax, structure, and grammar. 
Associated Deficits and Disorders
While not designated as specific subtypes of learning disabilities, there are a number of areas of information processing that are commonly associated with learning disabilities: 
                  * Auditory Processing Disorder is the term used to describe a weakness in the ability to understand and use auditory information. Individuals may have difficulties with noticing, comparing and distinguishing the distinct and separate sounds in words, picking out important sounds from a noisy background, recalling information presented orally, understanding and recalling the order of sounds and words, and difficulty with spelling, reading and written expression.
                  * Visual Processing Disorder is the term used to describe a weakness in the ability to understand and use visual information. Individuals often have difficulty noticing and comparing features of different items and distinguishing one item from another, distinguishing a shape or printed character from its background, distinguishing the order of symbols, words or images, difficulty engaging in short-term and long-term recall of visual information, and understanding how objects are positioned in space.
                  * Non-Verbal Learning Disabilities is the term used to describe the characteristics of individuals who have unique learning and behavioral profiles that may overlap with dyslexia, dyscalculia and dysgraphia but that differ in significant ways. Most notably, these individuals often have strengths in the areas of verbal expression, vocabulary, reading, comprehension, auditory memory and attention to detail, yet have difficulty with math computation and problem solving, visual-spatial tasks and motor coordination, reading body language and social cues, as well as seeing the “big picture” in social and academic contexts. 
                  * Executive Functioning Deficits is the term used to describe weaknesses in the ability to plan, organize, strategize, remember details and manage time and space efficiently. Executive functioning deficits are often seen in individuals who have a learning disability.
Learning Disability and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Learning Disability
People with learning disabilities may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with learning disabilities will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                  1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                  2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                  3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                  4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                  5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                  6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Leg Impairment
Leg impairments can arise from injuries, cancer, arthritis, diabetes, burns, and other conditions. They can be isolated to the leg or exist as a part of another condition. Limitations most often affect walking and can be painful. 
Leg Impairment and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Leg Impairment
People with limitations from a leg impairment may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with leg impairments will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                  1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                  2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                  3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                  4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                  5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                  6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations
                  * Limiting lifting, reaching, pushing, and pulling by job restructuring
                  * Using Proper Lifting Techniques
                  * Reallocating lifting duties, if marginal
                  * Providing assistance moving objects, to reduce weight
                  * Organizing items in a way that reduces the need to move or lift items
                  * Reducing weight to be lifted by separating items into smaller groups
                  * Reassigning an employee to a modified duty position or modifying duties by removing the lifting duties

About Little Person
JAN receives calls regarding accommodations for little people. Little people are typically those individuals of short stature ranging below 4'10". Some little people may not need any accommodations while others may need accommodations. Frequently requested accommodations include modifications to the work-site and work-station, accommodations for toiletings/grooming issues, and accommodations to maintain workplace safety. Typical limitations include orthopedic conditions such as spinal stenosis and joint disease as well as difficulty accessing workplace settings designed for an average-height person.
 
 
Little Person and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Little Person
Little people may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people who are little people will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Low Vision
Vision impairments result from conditions that range from the presence of some usable vision, low vision, to the absence of any vision, total blindness. Low vision is a term that describes a person with a vision impairment that cannot be improved by correction but has some usable vision remaining. Legal blindness is defined as 20/200 or less in the better eye with the best possible correction. Errors of refraction, diseases of the eye, and other vision-related conditions are usually the cause of vision loss. Each of these categories includes more specific disorders, which are described below.
•  Common Errors of Refraction
o  Myopia (Nearsightedness): Close objects look clear while distant objects appear blurred.
o  Hyperopia (Farsightedness): The ability to see objects clearly at a distance while close objects appear blurry.
o  Astigmatism: Due to the irregular curvature of the cornea, vision is blurry for both near and far objects.
o  Presbyopia: The eye lens becomes less elastic (associated with aging) and produces blurred vision when focusing on near objects.

•  Common Diseases of the Eye
o  Cataracts: Clouding of the eye’s lens that causes loss of vision.
o  Glaucoma: Pressure inside the eye is elevated and can cause damage to the optic nerve, which results in damage to peripheral vision.
o  Macular Degeneration: There is a disturbance of blood vessels in the eye resulting in progressive loss of central vision.
o  Retinitis Pigmentosa: There is a degeneration of pigment in the eye that is needed to absorb light and create visual images, leading to “tunnel vision” and night blindness.
o  Retinopathy (due to Diabetes): Retinopathy typically affects the blood circulation of the retina, which causes blotchy vision.
•  Other Vision Related Conditions
o  Night Blindness: Night blindness results from pigmentary degeneration of the retina, which leads to difficulty seeing in low light.
o  Color Vision Deficiency: A color vision deficiency occurs when cone cells of the retina, which provide daylight and color vision, are affected and there is difficulty distinguishing among colors. Typically this only involves certain hues, for example a red–green deficiency; total color blindness (achromatic vision) is rare.
o  Lack of Depth Perception: A lack of depth perception is often caused by the loss of sight in one eye, resulting in difficulty with foreground/background discrimination.
o  Floaters: Floaters are small specks or clouds moving in the field of vision.

Low Vision and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Low Vision
People with low vision may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations:
Reading Printed Materials: Individuals with vision impairment may have difficulty accessing printed text. Factors that may influence the readability of printed text include font size, style, color, contrast, and overall text legibility.
                     * Closed circuit television (CCTV) system, which is sometimes referred to as an electronic or video magnifier

About Lupus
Lupus is a widespread and chronic autoimmune disease that, for unknown reasons, causes the immune system to attack the body's own tissue and organs, including the joints, kidneys, heart, lungs, brain, blood, or skin. The immune system normally protects the body against viruses, bacteria, and other foreign materials. In an autoimmune disease like lupus, the immune system loses its ability to tell the difference between foreign substances and its own cells and tissue. The immune system then makes antibodies directed against "self." There are several forms of lupus: cutaneous, systemic, drug-induced, neonatal, and overlap syndrome or mixed connective tissue disease.
Although lupus can affect any part of the body, the most common symptoms are achy joints, frequent fevers, arthritis, fatigue, skin rashes, kidney problems, chest pain with deep breathing, a butterfly-shaped rash across the cheek and nose, photosensitivity, impaired vision, Raynaud's phenomenon, and seizures. No single set of symptoms is uniformly specific to lupus and no laboratory test can prove lupus conclusively; symptoms may disappear for no apparent reason and remain in remission for weeks, months, or even years.
Lupus and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment.

About Lyme Disease
Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which are transmitted to humans by the bite of infected deer ticks. Lyme disease is associated with a "bull's-eye" rash and/or lesion called erythema migrans. Other nonspecific symptoms include fever, malaise, fatigue, headache, and muscle and joint aches. Later symptoms of Lyme disease can include chronic pain, arthritis, meningitis, tingling and burning sensations in the extremities, Bell's palsy, chronic fatigue, depression, and heart, vision, respiratory, and gastrointestinal-related problems.
Lyme Disease and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Lyme Disease
People with Lyme disease may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with Lyme disease will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Marfan Syndrome
Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder of the connective tissue that can affect the skeleton, lungs, eyes, heart, and blood vessels. The condition affects both men and women of any race or ethnic group. It is estimated that at least 200,000 people in the United States have Marfan syndrome or a related connective tissue disorder.
Characteristics of the disorder vary greatly, but the most common problems associated with Marfan syndrome include heart problems, scoliosis, and near-sightedness. There is no cure for the disorder yet, but careful medical management can greatly improve the prognosis and lengthen the life span.
Marfan Syndrome and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Marfan Syndrome
People with Marfan syndrome may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with Marfan syndrome will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Mental Health Conditions
Approximately one in four adults experience a mental health condition. The DSM-5, the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which is published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), provides diagnostic criteria for mental health conditions. According to the DSM-5, a mental health condition is:
                     * a mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress in social, occupational, or other important activities. An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss, such as the death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder. Socially deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict results from a dysfunction in the individual, as described above.
The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) (n.d.a) defines a mental health condition as:
                     * a medical condition that disrupt a person's thinking, feeling, mood, ability to relate to others, and daily functioning. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illnesses are medical conditions that often result in a diminished capacity for coping with the ordinary demands of life.
JAN receives numerous accommodation questions related to individuals with mental health conditions working successfully. Although there are various definitions and lists of conditions, this document covers those that are received the most by JAN. NAMI provides useful definitions of mental health conditions and statistics on their prevalence. The following (NAMI, n.d.b) is a summary of these:
                     * Bipolar disorder, sometimes referred to as manic depression, "is a medical illness that causes extreme shifts in mood, energy, and functioning. Bipolar disorder is a chronic and generally life-long condition with recurring episodes of mania and depression that can last from days to months that often begin in adolescence or early adulthood, and occasionally even in children."
                     * Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is "an often misunderstood, serious mental illness characterized by pervasive instability in moods, interpersonal relationships, self image, and behavior. It is a disorder of emotional dysregulation. This instability often disrupts family and work, long-term planning, and the individual's sense of self-identity."
                     * Major depression is "persistent and can significantly interfere with an individual's thoughts, behavior, mood, activity, and physical health. Among all medical illnesses, major depression is the leading cause of disability in the United States and many other developed countries."
                     * Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) "occurs when an individual experiences obsessions and compulsions for more than an hour each day, in a way that interferes with his or her life."
                     * Panic disorder occurs when a person "experiences recurrent panic attacks, at least one of which leads to at least a month of increased anxiety or avoidant behavior. Panic disorder may also be indicated if a person experiences fewer than four panic episodes but has recurrent or constant fears of having another panic attack."
                     * Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is "an anxiety disorder that can occur after someone experiences a traumatic event that caused intense fear, helplessness, or horror. While it is common to experience a brief state of anxiety or depression after such occurrences, people with PTSD continually re-experience the traumatic event; avoid individuals, thoughts, or situations associated with the event; and have symptoms of excessive emotions. People with this disorder have these symptoms for longer than one month and cannot function as well as they did before the traumatic event. PTSD symptoms usually appear within three months of the traumatic experience; however, they sometimes occur months or even years later."
                     * Schizophrenia "often interferes with a person's ability to think clearly; to distinguish reality from fantasy; and to manage emotions, make decisions, and relate to others."
                     * Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is "characterized by recurrent episodes of depression – usually in late fall and winter – alternating with periods of normal or high mood the rest of the year." SAD is not regarded as a separate disorder by the DSM-5, but it is an added descriptor for the pattern of depressive episodes in patients with major depression or bipolar disorder.
JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations. 
Mental Health Conditions and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Mental Health Conditions
People with mental health conditions may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with mental health conditions will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations:
Managing Panic Attacks: For individuals with mental health conditions, having accommodations to help manage panic attacks can be helpful. 
                     * Flexible Schedule
                     * Modified Break Schedule
                     * Rest Area/Private Space
                     * Service Animal
                     * Support Animal
                     * Support Person
                     * Identify and Reduce Triggers
Rest Area/Private Space: An individual may need space to rest, take medication, or perform hygiene associated with activities of daily living. An area reserved as a rest area or private space could be a reasonable accommodation. For example, during or after a seizure, people with epilepsy may exhibit behaviors such as crying, drooling, spitting, or urinating. As a result, the person may need time following a seizure to engage in activities of daily living such as grooming and changing clothes. This type of space might also be helpful to those who have sleep disorders, diabetes, or who struggle with panic attacks.
Identify and Reduce Triggers: Some disabilities or medical conditions may have specific triggers that exacerbate symptoms. If triggers are present in the workplace, it can be helpful to identify what they are and explore accommodations to help. A variety of medical conditions may have associated triggers including migraines, seizure disorders, anxiety/panic disorders, PTSD, and fibromyalgia. The process of identifying triggers is individualized. Common examples are noise, light, and stress.

About Migraines
Migraines are recurring primary headaches that can cause severe throbbing or pulsing pain, and often come with additional symptoms such as nausea, light and noise sensitivity, weakness, and fatigue. The two most frequently discussed types of migraines in the literature are migraine with aura and migraine without aura. Migraines have no known cause, but are influenced by genetics, stress, diet, environment, medications, and more.
                     * Migraine with aura — less common; are accompanied by additional neurological symptoms usually related to visual disturbances
                     * Migraine without aura — the most common; 70-90% of those who experience migraines will not have an aura
The four phases of migraines.
                     * Prodome. This phase starts up to 24 hours before the migraine. Early signs and symptoms include food cravings, unexplained mood changes, uncontrollable yawning, fluid retention, and increased urination.
                     * Aura. If auras are present, they might include flashing or bright lights or zig-zag lines. Muscle weakness or a feeling of being touched or grabbed may occur. An aura can happen just before or during a migraine.
                     * Headache. A migraine usually starts gradually and then becomes more severe. It typically causes throbbing or pulsing pain, often on one side of the head. But sometimes a migraine can occur without a headache. Other migraine symptoms may include
                     * Increased sensitivity to light, noise, and odors
                     * Nausea and vomiting
                     * Worsened pain when moving, coughing, or sneezing
                     * Postdrome (following the headache). Symptoms may include exhaustion, weakness, and confusion after a migraine. This can last up to a day.

Migraines and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Migraines
People with migraines may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with migraines will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Multiple Chemical Sensitivity
Multiple Chemical Sensitivity/Environmental Illness (MCS/EI) is an inability to tolerate an environmental chemical or class of chemicals. It usually develops from exposure to substances in the environment and may result in intolerance to even very low levels of chemicals. Symptoms can occur in more than one organ system in the body, such as the nervous system, the lungs, and the heart. Exposures can come through the air, from food and water, or through the skin. MCS/EI causes different symptoms in different people. Symptoms may include: headaches, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, breathing difficulties, tightening of the throat, difficulty concentrating, memory loss, learning disorders, eczema, arthritis-like sensations, and muscle pain. A person who experiences limitations due to MCS/EI may have any of the above mentioned symptoms when exposed to such irritants as fragrances, cleaning agents, smoke, pesticides, molds, office machines, car exhaust, paint, new carpeting, solvents, poor indoor air quality, and others. There are specific considerations to consider when accommodating an individual with MCS/EI. 
Ventilation and Indoor Air Quality Issues:
                     * Provide an office or workspace that has working windows.
                     * Make certain the ventilation system is not distributing pollutants throughout the work-site from locations within or outside of the building.
                     * Use HEPA filters in the ventilation system if possible and have ducts maintained.
                     * Have an air quality test performed by an industrial hygiene professional to assess poor air quality, dust, mold or mildew accumulation, VOC concentration, etc.
                     * Work with specialists in the industrial hygiene field by contacting resources like the American Industrial Hygiene Association for a member referral.
                     * Use air purification systems throughout the building or in personal workstations. Work with specialists in the air filtration field by contacting resources like The National Air Filtration Association for a member referral.
                     * Maintain a work environment which is free of pollutants such as fragrances, toxic cleaning agents, pesticides, exhaust fumes, tobacco smoke, etc.
                     * Provide adequate exhaust systems to remove fumes from copiers and similar office machines.
Construction, Remodeling, and Cleaning Issues:
                     * Provide pre-notification of events such as remodeling, painting, pesticide applications, floor waxing, and carpet shampooing by way of signs, memos, e-mail or an employee register. A voluntary registry can be created for people to be notified on a regular basis.
                     * Allow for alternative work arrangements for those people who may be sensitive to the chemical agents used in the above activities such as offering the use of another office, work on another floor of the building, work outside, or work from home.
                     * Use non-toxic building materials, furnishings, and supplies.
                     * Use non-toxic carpeting or alternative floor covering such as tile or cotton throw rugs. Products can be used to reduce the out-gassing of newly laid carpeting.
                     * If industrial products are being used such as solvents, primers, stains, paints, lubricants, etc., consider any alternative products that could possibly be used that may not illicit an MCS/EI reaction.
                     * If possible, have cleaning, maintenance, and remodeling activities performed when the building is not occupied to reduce employee exposure to these activities.
                     * Discontinue the use of toxic pesticides and opt for an alternative pest management policy. Contact resources like the National Pesticide Telecommunications Network or the National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides to find out more about alternative pest management practices.
                     * Discontinue the use of synthetic lawn care products.
Multiple Chemical Sensitivity and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Multiple Chemical Sensitivity
People with multiple chemical sensitivity may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with multiple chemical sensitivity will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Multiple Sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. It causes destruction of myelin (a protein that forms a protective coating around nerve cells) in the central nervous system. When myelin is destroyed signals traveling through the nerve cells are interrupted or delayed, resulting in various neurologic symptoms occurring at different locations throughout the body. The progress, severity, and specific symptoms of multiple sclerosis in any one person cannot yet be redacted, but advances in research and treatment are giving hope to those affected by the disease.
Multiple sclerosis is often characterized by a pattern of exacerbation and remission. Symptoms may be mild, such as numbness in the limbs, or severe, such as paralysis or loss of vision. Possible symptoms include fatigue, loss of coordination, muscle weakness, spasticity, numbness, slurred speech, visual difficulties, paralysis, muscle cramps, bladder or bowel problems, and sexual dysfunction.
The initial symptoms of MS are most often difficulty walking; abnormal sensations such as numbness or "pins and needles"; and pain and loss of vision due to optic neuritis, an inflammation of the optic nerve. Less common initial symptoms may include tremor; lack of coordination; slurred speech; sudden onset of paralysis, similar to a stroke; and decline in cognitive function.
JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations. 11
Multiple Sclerosis and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Multiple Sclerosis
People with multiple sclerosis may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with multiple sclerosis will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Muscular Dystrophy
Muscular dystrophy refers to a group of genetic diseases marked by progressive weakness and degeneration of the skeletal, or voluntary, muscles, which control movement. The muscles of the heart and some other involuntary muscles are also affected in some forms of muscular dystrophy, and a few forms involve other organs as well. The major forms of muscular dystrophy are myotonic, Duchenne, Becker, limb-girdle, facioscapulohumeral, congenital, oculopharyngeal, distal, and Emery-Dreifuss. All forms of muscular dystrophy are caused by gene defects. Individuals with muscular dystrophy usually exhibit contractures, a condition often associated with shortened muscles around the joints. Due to the abnormal and sometimes painful positioning of the joints, most individuals have extreme fatigue and weakness as well as speech, mobility, and fine motor limitations. In addition, scoliosis, or curvature of the spine, is common). Muscular dystrophy is generally inherited but in some cases no family history of the disease may exist. It can affect people of all ages. While some forms first become apparent in infancy or childhood, others may not appear until middle age or later.
Muscular Dystrophy and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Muscular Dystrophy
People with muscular dystrophy may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with muscular dystrophy will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
ME/CFS is a complex illness and symptoms of ME/CFS may seem similar to many other illnesses. ME/CFS requires three symptoms:
Not being able to participate in routine activities that were possible before becoming ill, such as work, school, social life, and/or personal life, that:
                     * Lasts for more than 6 months
                     * Is accompanied by fatigue that is:
                     * Often serious
                     * Just started (not lifelong)
                     * Not the result of ongoing activities
                     * Not from more than usual effort
                     * Not made better by rest
Post-exertional malaise (PEM). Worsening of symptoms after physical, mental, or emotional effort that would not have caused a problem before the illness. Symptom onset can be immediate or delayed for hours or days. This is sometimes referred to as “crashing” by people with ME/CFS.
Unrefreshing sleep. People with ME/CFS may not feel better even after a full night of sleep (e.g., feeling just as tired upon waking up as before going to bed).
In addition, at least one of the following symptoms is also required: Impaired memory or ability to concentrate. People with ME/CFS may have trouble remembering, learning new things, concentrating, or making decisions.
Orthostatic intolerance (symptoms that occur while standing or sitting upright). People with ME/CFS may feel lightheaded or dizzy when standing upright and may even faint.
 
OTHER COMMON SYMPTOMS:
                     * Muscle pain
                     * Pain in the joints without swelling or redness
                     * Headaches of a new type, pattern, or severity
                     *  Swollen or tender lymph nodes in the neck or armpit
                     * A sore throat that is frequent or recurring
                     * Gastrointestinal symptoms
                     * Genitourinary symptoms
                     * Sensitivity to light, sound, touch, and smell
                     * Chills and night sweats
                     * Visual disturbances
                     * Nausea
                     * Allergies or sensitivities to foods, odors, chemicals, or medications
Disease onset can be either gradual or sudden, and the course can be unpredictable and varies by individual. Some individuals report that even everyday activities (e.g., grocery shopping, attending medical appointments) can worsen their symptoms. The effects of ME/CFS can be substantially limiting.
Currently, there are no medications approved specifically for the treatment of ME/CFS. However, healthcare providers can treat the symptoms and comorbid conditions. Techniques to help individuals cope with the disease can also improve their quality of life.
Managing PEM should be considered to limit symptoms. During PEM, other symptoms may get worse or first appear, including difficulty thinking, problems sleeping, sore throat, headaches, feeling dizzy, or severe fatigue. PEM can start immediately after the exertion or be delayed for hours or days. It may take days, weeks, or longer to recover from a crash. Sometimes individuals may not be able to leave their home or even get out of bed during crashes. People with PEM may not always be able to predict what will cause a crash or how long it will last. Practicing pacing strategies to minimize and manage PEM can lead to stabilization or improvements in pain, sleep, fatigue, cognition, and other symptoms. It can also prevent worsening of these symptoms. Pacing activity may improve quality of life considerably and even increase function.
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
People with ME/CFS may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with ME/CFS will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Myasthenia Gravis
The name “Myasthenia Gravis” comes from the Greek and Latin words meaning “grave muscular weakness.” The most common form of myasthenia gravis is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorder that is characterized by fluctuating weakness of the voluntary muscle groups, which worsens with use of the affected muscle. Different muscle groups are affected in different individuals. Certain muscles are more frequently involved, including the ones that control eye movements, eyelids, chewing, swallowing, coughing, and facial expression. Muscles that control breathing and movements of the arms and legs may also be affected. Weakness of the muscles needed for breathing may cause shortness of breath, difficulty taking a deep breath, and coughing. The "gravis" or seriousness of myasthenia is noticeable when breathing muscles are affected.
Myasthenia Gravis and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Myasthenia Gravis
People with myasthenia gravis may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with myasthenia gravis will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Neurodiversity
What is neurodiversity?
Neurodiversity describes the natural way that people think, learn, perceive the world, interact and process information differently and in unique ways. Although this term is often used to refer to people on the autism spectrum, it also includes a wide range of people with cognitive, intellectual, developmental, and neurological conditions that shape how people think and learn. For example, neurodivergent people include:
                     * autistic people;
                     * people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD);
                     * those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health conditions; and
                     * people with learning disabilities, including dyslexia.
Neurodiversity and the Americans with Disabilities Act
Is neurodiversity a disability?
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Neurodiversity
What are common workplace challenges faced by neurodivergent employees?
Workplace challenges for neurodivergent employees can vary greatly from person to person. Some common challenges reported by neurodivergent employees, family members, advocates, providers of work supports and services, and employers include:
                     * Social skills
                     * Organization
                     * Concentration
                     * Sensory issues
                     * Time management
                     * Performing work effectively
                     * Stress management
                     * Interaction with coworkers
                     * Speaking and communicating
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations 
Some neurodivergent employees who meet the ADA definition of a disability, may need work accommodations to help them perform their work and maximize their talents and skills. Others may not. Accommodations should always be considered on a case-by-case basis, regardless of an employee’s disability or diagnosis. Below are some accommodation suggestions to explore when needed. 
Accommodation ideas during recruitment and hiring:
                     * Fewer interviewers in a single setting
                     * Detailed instructions or note cards 
                     * Interview questions provided in advance 
                     * A job coach or family member as a support person
                     * Alternate assessments and/or demonstration of actual job skills and related talents
                     * Informational phone interview held before traditional interview 
Accommodation ideas to help sustain employment:
                     * Traditional and peer mentoring 
                     * Frequent and ongoing manager feedback and positive reinforcement
                     * Service or emotional support animal use 
                     * Remote work with needed assistive technology 
                     * Job task restructuring
                     * Workplace policy modifications, including flexible breaks
                     * Workplace modifications for sensitivities involving light, noise, and temperatures 
                     * Employee Assistance Program (EAP) support
                     * Skills training

About Obesity
Obesity is used to describe a person that is above their ideal weight by about 20% or more. This can correspond with a BMI (Body Mass Index) of 30+. In addition to behavioral and dietary patterns, other things can influence a person's weight, from genetics to medications to illnesses. Obesity is associated with gallstones, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, and respiratory conditions. It can also increase the chances of health problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, and heart disease. The risk of certain cancers, such as breast, colon, kidney, liver, and others can also be increased with obesity.
Obesity and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Obesity
People with obesity may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with obesity will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?

About Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a type of anxiety disorder that affects millions of adults. Other conditions can accompany OCD, resulting in a dual-diagnosis, including eating disorders, other anxiety disorders, and depression. Symptoms of OCD include persistent, upsetting thoughts (obsessions) and the use of rituals (compulsions) to control the anxiety those thoughts produce. These rituals can end up controlling individuals with OCD and negatively impact their personal and work life, resulting in the need for accommodations at work. Common problems in the workplace for employees with OCD that may require reasonable accommodation include attendance and punctuality issues, the ability to meet deadlines and stay organized, and problems maintaining concentration and managing distractions. 
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
People with OCD may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with OCD will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Paraplegia
People use wheelchairs for a variety of reasons, the most common reason being paralysis from spinal cord injuries. Individuals who have had a stroke, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, polio, cerebral palsy, back condition, cancer, diabetes, traumatic brain injury, and dementia may also have limitations that result in paraplegia. Paraplegia is a condition that results from paralysis in the legs and potentially the trunk. 
Paraplegia and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Paraplegia
People with paraplegia may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with paraplegia will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Parkinson's Disease
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic, slowly progressive neurological condition. PD can produce various symptoms such as resting tremors on one side of the body, slowness of movement, stiffness of limbs, gait or balance problems, small cramped handwriting, lack of arm swing, decreased facial expression, lowered voice volume, feelings of depression or anxiety, episodes of feeling "stuck in place" when initiating a step, slight foot drag, increase in dandruff or oily skin, and less frequent blinking and swallowing. 
JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations. 
Parkinson's Disease and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Parkinson's Disease
People with Parkinson’s disease may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with Parkinson’s disease will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Personality Disorder
A personality disorder is an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to distress or impairment.  There are 10 specific personality disorders. They are as follows:
                     * Paranoid personality disorder – a pattern of distrust and suspiciousness such that others' motives are interpreted as malevolent.
                     * Schizoid personality disorder – a pattern of detachment from social relationship and a restricted range of emotional expression.
                     * Schizotypal personality disorder – a pattern of acute discomfort in close relationships, cognitive or perceptual distortions, and eccentricities of behavior.
                     * Antisocial personality disorder – a pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others.
                     * Borderline personality disorder – a pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity.
                     * Histrionic personality disorder – a pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking.
                     * Narcissistic personality disorder – a pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy.
                     * Avoidant personality disorder – a pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation.
                     * Dependent personality disorder – a pattern of submissive and clinging behavior related to an excessive need to be taken care of.
                     * Obsessive compulsive personality disorder – a pattern of preoccupations with orderliness, perfectionism, and control.
JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations. 
Personality Disorder and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Personality Disorder
People with personality disorders may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with personality disorders will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Phobias
Phobias are irrational, involuntary, and inappropriate fears of (or responses to) ordinary situations or things. The fear is persistent and out of proportion to the actual danger the object or situation poses. People who have phobias can experience panic attacks when confronted with the situation or object about which they feel phobic. A category of symptoms called phobic disorder falls within the broader field of anxiety disorders. Phobias are usually long-term, distressing disorders that keep people from ordinary activities and places. They can lead to other serious problems, such as social isolation and depression.
Phobias and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Phobias
People with phobias may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with phobias will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations:
Managing Panic Attacks: For individuals with mental health conditions, having accommodations to help manage panic attacks can be helpful.

About Poliomyelitis (Polio)/Post Polio
Polio (poliomyelitis) is a disorder caused by a viral infection (poliovirus) that can affect the whole body, including muscles and nerves. Severe cases may cause permanent paralysis or death. Polio occurs worldwide; however, no cases of polio have been reported in the United States in recent years (the last case of non-vaccine related polio acquired in the United States was in 1979).
Poliomyelitis (Polio)/Post Polio and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).

About Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a trauma-related disorder caused by an individual’s exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence in one or more of the following ways:
                     * directly experiences the traumatic event;
                     * witnesses the traumatic event in person;
                     * learns that the traumatic event occurred to a close family member or close friend (with the actual or threatened death being either violent or accidental); or
                     * experiences first-hand repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the traumatic event (not through media, pictures, television, or movies unless work-related).
The disturbance, regardless of its trigger, causes clinically significant distress or impairment in the indi­vidual's interactions and capacity to work. Be aware that some individuals with PTSD will never need an accommodation, while other may need accommodations that change over time.
JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations.
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
People with PTSD may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with PTSD will need accommodations to perform their jobs, and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)
Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is a form of dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system’s ability to regulate heart rate. With POTS, the body is not able to keep heart rate at steady and stable levels. A variety of symptoms are associated with POTS, which may include but are not limited to angina (chest pain sometimes radiating down the left arm or into the jaw); dizziness or lightheadedness that often manifests during periods of prolonged periods of walking, prolonged periods of standing in one static position, or when standing up suddenly from seated positions; syncope (fainting); chronic fatigue; tremors, exercise intolerance; hypo or hypertension, and gastric upset.
Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)
People with POTS may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but rarely develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with POTS will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available should any situation or need arise. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations
Decreased Stamina/Fatigue: Individuals with POTS can become fatigued to the extent they cannot work a full shift or perform physical aspects of their role.
                     * Allow frequent breaks
                     * Allow flexible scheduling and flexible leave

                     * Provide chairs with armrests and locking casters so that individuals can steady themselves when standing up without worry that the chair will move
                     * Provide stools or chairs to allow for alternating between standing and sitting
                     * Allow additional rest breaks or modify when tasks are done to break up periods of prolonged walking
Gross Motor: Individuals with POTS may experience short- or long-term gross motor limitations.
                     * Implement ergonomic considerations
                     * Provide equipment: e.g., lifting devices, carts
                     * Permit the use of mobility aids and/or service animal
Effect of/ Receive Medical Treatment: Individuals with POTS may need time to attend medical appointments or recover from a medical treatment or procedure.
                     * Allow work from home
                     * Allow flexible scheduling and flexible leave

About Pregnancy
Pregnancy affects women in different ways. For some women, it can bring about various physical and emotional changes that can affect the ability to perform certain job tasks. Some women experience no or very few limitations, while others may experience limitations that create the need for job accommodations. For example, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, or pain and swelling might impact attendance or working long hours; restrictions in lifting, standing, or bending might affect the ability to meet some of the physical demands of a job; hormonal fluctuations might impact concentration and memory or cause anxiety; or the need to eat and drink frequently, or wear more comfortable clothing might affect adherence to certain policies. Pregnancy-related medical conditions like gestational diabetes, back pain, anemia, high blood pressure (known as preeclampsia), urinary tract infections, severe dehydration, depression, complications requiring bed rest, and the after-effects of delivery can also create limitations. Pregnancy and childbirth may exacerbate existing health conditions as well.
Pregnancy and the Americans with Disabilities Act
Does federal law require employers to make accommodations for workers who are pregnant?
Yes. Several federal laws protect job applicants and employees who are pregnant from discrimination and/or may require covered employers to make reasonable accommodations for workers with known limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. These laws include the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) when there is a disability related to pregnancy. Similarly, many state laws provide protections for workers who are pregnant. Additionally, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) requires covered employers to provide unpaid, job-protected leave for family and medical reasons, including the birth or adoption of a child.
What does the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) require?
The PWFA is a federal law that requires covered employers to make reasonable accommodations for qualified applicants and employees with a known physical or mental condition related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions ("known limitation"), unless undue hardship will result. "Known" means the employee or the employee’s representative has communicated the limitation to the employer. "Reasonable accommodation" generally means a change in the work environment or how things are usually done. Some examples of possible reasonable accommodations under the PWFA include:
                     * Additional, longer, or more flexible breaks to drink water, eat, rest, or use the restroom;
                     * Changing food or drink policies to allow for a water bottle or food;
                     * Changing equipment, devices, or workstations, such as providing a stool to sit on, or a way to do work while standing;
                     * Changing a uniform or dress code or providing safety equipment that fits;
                     * Changing a work schedule, such as having shorter hours, part-time work, or a later start time;
                     * Telework;
                     * Temporary reassignment;
                     * Temporary suspension of one or more essential functions of a job;
                     * Leave for health care appointments;
                     * Light duty or help with lifting or other manual labor; or
                     * Leave to recover from childbirth or other medical conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth.

What does the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) require?
The ADA requires covered employers to provide reasonable accommodations to workers with disabilities, so long as doing so does not impose an undue hardship on the employer. Pregnancy alone is not an ADA disability but many pregnancy-related impairments are ADA disabilities. A pregnancy-related impairment is a disability if it substantially limits one or more major life activities or substantially limited major life activities in the past. For example, pregnancy-related conditions may include anemia, sciatica, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, morning sickness, swelling in the legs, depression, or other impairments that substantially limit a major life activity or the normal functioning of a bodily system. Reasonable accommodations vary but might include a modified work schedule; the ability to have snacks or drinks at a workstation; a modified attendance policy; additional or frequent breaks; sitting; lifting assistance, job restructuring, or light duty work; telework; or leave to attend medical appointments, among other solutions.
What does Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), require?
Title VII, as amended by the PDA, prohibits pregnancy-based discrimination and harassment and requires covered employers to make work adjustments for workers who are pregnant. The law forbids employment discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth, or medical conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth. It also requires that workers who are temporarily unable to perform or are limited in performing job functions due to pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition, be treated in the same manner as other employees who are similar in their ability or inability to work. This might include making work adjustments like providing light duty work, alternative work assignments, allowing additional breaks, or providing unpaid leave. For example, an employer with a policy of accommodating most non-pregnant employees with lifting limitations would be required to also accommodate pregnant employees with lifting limitations.

Accommodating Employees with Pregnancy
Workers who are pregnant may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all women who are pregnant will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Quadriplegia
People use wheelchairs for a variety of reasons, the most common reason being paralysis from spinal cord injuries. There are several hundred thousand individuals living with a spinal cord injury or spinal dysfunction. Most of these individuals are male. Also, people with arthritis, multiple sclerosis, back conditions, cancer, and other impairments may use wheelchairs to assist with mobility.
Quadriplegia and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Quadriplegia
People with limitations from quadriplegia may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people who are aging will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Raynaud's Disease
Raynaud’s phenomenon is a rare condition that when exposed to cold temperatures or emotional stress, it causes the blood vessels to narrow resulting in numbness, tingling, and/or burning in one’s extremities. Most often it will affect a person’s fingers and toes, but can also affect the nose, ears, and lips. Minor fluctuations in temperature can cause people to have flare-ups. 
There are two main types of Raynaud’s, primary being a standalone disease and the cause is unknown. Secondary is known as Raynaud’s phenomenon and/or syndrome often stemming from a known primary disease, often lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. 

Raynaud's Disease and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment.

About Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD)
Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a condition described as a chronic pain occurring as a result of trauma to a soft tissue or bone (Type I) or nerve injury (Type II).  Type I CRPS is also called reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) and causalgia. A progressive disease of the nervous system, symptoms of pain and burning can affect one, two, three, or all for limbs.  In extreme cases other or all parts of the body may be affected.  Complications to the condition include depression, anxiety, and atrophy.
Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD) and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD)
People with limitations from complex regional pain syndrome or reflex sympathetic dystrophy may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people who are aging will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.

Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Renal/Kidney Disease
Kidney diseases are diseases of the kidney substance that alter the structure and function of the kidney. There are many diseases of the kidneys such as glomerulonephritis, pylonephritis, polycystic kidney, and lupus nephritis. The treatment and potential for recovery depends on the type of disease. Kidney diseases can lead to kidney failure. 
When an individual has mild kidney failure, dialysis or renal transplant is not required. However, the individual may need to take certain medications and abide by dietary restrictions. Dialysis is needed when the body alone can no longer remove enough waste products to sustain life.There are two forms of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis is a process where excess waste products and water are removed from the patient's blood, which is drawn through a special created vein in the forearm, into a dialysis solution. Hemodialysis requires the use of a machine and one dialysis session takes about four hours to complete, usually three times a week. Peritoneal dialysis is performed by introducing dialysis solution into the peritoneal (abdominal) cavity through a catheter. Waste products and excess water from the body are passed through a natural membrane lining of the peritoneal cavity, and the solution can be drained out of the abdomen into a bag and be thrown away. Peritoneal dialysis usually involves four exchanges per day. Accommodations for individuals with kidney disease differ dramatically from one person to another. 

Renal/Kidney Disease and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).

About Respiratory Impairments
Respiratory impairment is a generic term that refers to a number of medical conditions that can affect the respiratory system and may result in limitations such as labored breathing or asthma attacks, fatigue and difficulty with mobility, heightened sensitivity to ordinary substances and chemicals, and compromised immunity to infection.
The following is a non-comprehensive list of many of the medical conditions that may result in respiratory impairments: Allergies, Asthma, Chemical Sensitivity (MCS), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Cystic Fibrosis, Environmental Illness (EI), Fragrance Sensitivity, Lung Cancer, Pulmonary Sarcoidosis, Tuberculosis, Emphysema, Pulmonary Hypertension, Latex Allergy, and AIDS Related Lung Disease.
Respiratory Impairments and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Respiratory Impairments
People with respiratory impairments may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with respiratory impairments will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations
Environmental Triggers: Some respiratory impairments are aggravated by environmental triggers.
                     * Maintain a clean and healthy work environment
                     * Condition, heat, dehumidify, or add moisture to the air as appropriate
                     * Provide additional rest breaks for the individual to get fresh air or take medication
                     * Create a smoke and fragrance-free work environment
                     * Allow for alternative work arrangements when construction is taking place
                     * Use alternative pest management practices
                     * Allow for alternative means of communication such as telephone, e-mail, instant messaging, fax, or memos
Accessibility: An individual who experiences respiratory limitations may have difficulty performing activities that require gross motor movement, such as walking long distances, or performing activities that require excessive physical activity. It may be necessary to address access concerns for an individual who has difficulty approaching the work facility, moving around the facility, getting to work, or traveling as an essential job function.
                     * Provide an entrance free of steps with doors that open automatically or that have a maximum opening force of five pounds
                     * Provide an accessible route of travel to and from work areas used by the individual throughout the work environment
                     * Consider providing a scooter or motorized cart for the employee to use for long distances if the employee does not already use a mobility aid
                     * Move the individual’s workstation closer to equipment, materials, and rooms the individual uses frequently
                     * Modify the workstation to accommodate a wheelchair, scooter, or the use of oxygen therapy equipment
                     * Arrange the workstation so materials and equipment are within reach range
                     * Provide restrooms that are easily accessed from the individual's workstation
                     * Review emergency evacuation procedures
Policy Modification: Due to the unpredictable nature of the onset of respiratory limitations, an individual may have difficulty maintaining regular attendance or a regular schedule.
                     * Modify the location where work is performed
                     * Modify the attendance policy
                     * Provide leave as an accommodation
                     * Provide a modified or part-time work schedule
                     * Provide breaks
Air Quality: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides suggestions for improving indoor air quality in its article, An Office Building Occupant's Guide to Indoor Air Quality. Employers should keep indoor air quality concerns in mind for employees with and without respiratory impairments. Good IAQ can improve worker productivity for everyone.
                     * Provide an office or workspace that has working windows
                     * Maintain the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system
                     * Test indoor air quality
                     * Use air purification systems throughout the building or in personal workstations
                     * Reduce workplace pollutants
                     * Adjust indoor temperature to meet the individual’s needs
                     * Institute a fragrance-free workplace
                     * Provide pre-notification of construction and cleaning in the workplace
                     * Use non-toxic building materials, furnishings, supplies, and flooring
                     * Use non-toxic solvents, primers, stains, paints, etc.

About Sarcoidosis
Sarcoidosis (SAR-coy-DOH-sis) is an inflammatory disease characterized by granulomas (small rounded outgrowths made up of blood vessels, cells, and connective tissues) that can produce many different symptoms. It is generally a chronic disease, lasting for several years or a lifetime. Some people, however, may have a type that only lasts a few months.
Some people may have no symptoms; others may have symptoms that include: skin, lung, and eye problems; arthritis; myositis; fever; fatigue; and weight loss. 
Sarcoidosis and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Sarcoidosis
People with sarcoidosis may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people who are aging will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.

About Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that interferes with a person’s ability to think clearly, manage emotions, make decisions and relate to others. People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality. Although schizophrenia is not as common as other mental disorders, the symptoms can be incapacitating. 
The symptoms of schizophrenia, include:
                     * Hallucinations include a person hearing voices, seeing things, or smelling things others can’t perceive. The hallucination is very real to the person experiencing it, and it may be very confusing for someone else to witness. The voices in the hallucination can be critical or threatening. Voices may involve people that are known or unknown to the person hearing them.
                     * Delusions are false beliefs that don’t change even when the person who holds them is presented with new ideas or facts. People who have delusions often also have problems concentrating, confused thinking, or the sense that their thoughts are blocked.
                     * Negative symptoms diminish a person’s abilities, and include being emotionally flat or speaking in a dull, disconnected way. People with the negative symptoms may be unable to start or follow through with activities, show little interest in life, or sustain relationships. Negative symptoms are sometimes confused with clinical depression.
                     * Cognitive issues/disorganized thinking involve struggling to remember things, organize thoughts, or complete tasks. Commonly, the individual with schizophrenia is unaware that he has the illness, which can make treating or working with him much more challenging.
Schizophrenia and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Schizophrenia
People with schizophrenia may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with schizophrenia will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)
Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that is exacerbated by gray overcast skies and poor indoor lighting. Some common symptoms of SAD are:
                     * Oversleeping;
                     * Fatigue;
                     * Feeling lethargic;
                     * Irritability and stress intolerance; and
                     * Lack of interest in daily activities, sex, or social interactions.
Treatment for SAD usually involves medication combined with light therapy. Light therapy is exposure to high intensity bright lights, typically referred to as light or sun boxes. An individual spends a period of time each day exposed to this light, and treatment can last from 30 minutes to 2 hours per day. Many of these light boxes are portable and can be placed on a desk or table in the work environment.
Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)
People with seasonal affective disorder may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with SAD will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Four basic light products are available to accommodate workers with SAD:
                     * Sun Boxes and Lights: These are rectangular light fixtures that have several fluorescent tubes that produce between 5,000 and 10,000 lux and come in many different sizes and styles.
                     * Light Visors: These are head-mounted light sources that resembling tennis visors and are good choices for people who do not have sedentary jobs or need to be mobile during the day.
                     * Sun Simulating Desk Lamps: These resemble typical office lamps.
                     * Dawn Simulators: These are devices that mimic natural sunrises by gradually brightening rooms over programmed periods of time.
JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Shingles
Shingles, herpes zoster, is a reactivation of the chickenpox virus (the varicella-zoster virus). After having chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus retreats to nerve cells in the body, where it often lies dormant for many years. Like other members of the herpes family (such as the herpes simplex viruses that cause cold sores and genital herpes), the varicella-zoster virus that causes chickenpox never leaves the body.
Certain factors, such as stress, aging, or low immunity, can reactivate the virus and it begins to reproduce. The virus travels along the path of a nerve (where the virus "slept") to the skin's surface and becomes visible as shingles. Shingles causes numbness, tingling, itching, or pain before a blistery rash appears. This rash appears as fluid-filled blisters. Because shingles occurs in an area of the skin that is supplied by sensory fibers of a single nerve, called a dermatome, the rash usually appears in a strip on one side of the body, typically the torso, face, nose, and eyes.
Diagnosis is difficult before the rash appears and may be mistaken for conditions such as appendicitis or heart attack. Treatments focus on shortening the duration of the shingles outbreak and controlling the associated pain, but there is not currently a vaccine distributed to prevent shingles. Shingles may lead to a chronic painful condition called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) that can be difficult to treat, and many individuals who experience shingles have pain in the affected area during periods of short-term stress. A small percentage of people have more than one occurrence of shingles.
Shingles and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Shingles
People with shingles may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with shingles will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Sickle Cell Anemia
Sickle cell anemia, or sickle cell disease, is a genetically inherited blood disorder that affects the shape of red blood cells.  Red blood cells are normally round, smooth, and soft, which allows them to move easily through the blood system.  In sickle cell disease, blood cells are crescent, or sickle-shaped, and rigid.  This is due to blood cells that contain an abnormal type of hemoglobin.  The abnormal shape of red blood cells prevents the cells from properly moving through blood vessels and carrying oxygen to all parts of the body.  The sickle-shaped blood cells die sooner than ordinary blood cells, which results in significantly fewer red blood cells and causes anemia.
People with sickle cell disease experience chronic anemia and periodic episodes of pain, sometimes referred to as “crisis.”  When the sickle-shaped blood cells block the flow of blood and oxygen to the limbs and organs of the body, severe pain and damage to tissues and organs can result.  People can experience pain episodes affecting the arms, legs, chest, and abdomen; damage to the lungs, spleen, kidneys, and liver, among other organs; have a stroke; and develop acute chest syndrome and bacterial infections.  Symptoms can range from mild to very severe.
Sickle cell disease is a lifelong, chronic condition, and its symptoms can be treated, but for most people there is no cure.  People with sickle cell disease often require prophylactic antibiotics, folic acid supplementation, pain management, intravenous fluids, and frequent blood transfusions.  Blood transfusions reduce recurrent pain crises, the risk of stroke, and other complications.

Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Sickle Cell Anemia
People with sickle cell anemia may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people who are aging will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Skin Conditions
The skin is the body’s largest organ and functions to protect the body from irritants. When encountering an irritant, signals are sent to the brain to isolate and destroy the irritant often causing redness, swelling, fever, and itching. In the case of some skin conditions, such as contact dermatitis, this reaction is caused when coming into contact with an external trigger. Other conditions like eczema, psoriasis, and scleroderma produce similar manifestations in response to an internal immune system trigger.
Limitations associated with skin conditions can include light sensitivity, suppressed immune system, skin irritations, fine and gross motor movement, mobility, temperature sensitivity, pain management, and stress management.
Skin Conditions and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Skin Conditions
For people with skin conditions and related limitations, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people with skin conditions will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
Key Accommodations
Skin Irritations: Many skin conditions result in irritation to the skin, including rashes, sores, and lesions.

                     * Limit invasive procedures (activities that could exacerbate skin condition)
Ultraviolet Sensitivity: Individuals with skin conditions that decrease their tolerance to ultraviolet light may need accommodations to limit sun exposure and certain indoor lighting.
                     * Provide schedule that avoids direct high-sun exposure
                     * Provide protective clothing

About Sleep Disorder
Several types of sleep disorders exist and have various symptoms. Insomnia, sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and restless legs syndrome are among the most common. Sleep disorders are neurological conditions that change the way you sleep. They can affect general health, safety and quality of life. Sleep deprivation can affect your ability to drive safely and increase your risk of other health problems.

Some of the signs and symptoms of sleep disorders include excessive daytime sleepiness, irregular breathing or increased movement during sleep, and difficulty falling asleep. There are many different types of sleep disorders. They're often grouped into categories that explain why they happen or how they affect you. Sleep disorders can also be grouped according to behaviors, problems with your natural sleep-wake cycles, breathing problems, difficulty sleeping or how sleepy you feel during the day.
 
Some common types of sleep disorders include:
•  Insomnia involves difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep throughout the night.
•  Sleep apnea, in which you experience abnormal patterns in breathing while you are asleep. There are several types of sleep apnea.
•  Restless legs syndrome (RLS), a type of sleep movement disorder. Restless legs syndrome, also called Willis-Ekbom disease, causes an uncomfortable sensation and an urge to move the legs while you try to fall asleep.
•  Narcolepsy, a condition characterized by extreme sleepiness during the day and falling asleep suddenly during the day.
 
There are many ways to help diagnose sleep disorders. Doctors can usually treat most sleep disorders effectively once they're correctly diagnosed. Accommodation may help individuals adjust during treatment or to new sleep patterns. 

JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations.
Sleep Disorder and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Sleep Disorder
People with sleep disorders may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people who are aging will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

Following is a list of speech and language disorders including information from the American Speech-Language, Hearing Association (ASHA).
                     *  Aphasia is impaired expression or comprehension of written or spoken language. Aphasia is often caused by stroke, brain injury or Alzheimer's dementia.
                     * Dysarthria results in difficulty pronouncing words like "cat" or sounds like "sh" and "ba." Dysarthria may be caused by a degenerative neurological disorder or alcohol intoxication.
                     * Dysphonias can be present in one of two forms, adductor or abductor. The adductor type produces a strained or strangled voice quality. Abductor sounds like chronic hoarseness or breathy and effortful speech. 
                     * Esophageal speech is a technique whereby a person takes air in through the mouth, traps it in the throat, and then releases it. As the air is released, it makes the upper parts of the throat/esophagus vibrate and produces sound. This sound is still shaped into words with the lips, tongue, teeth, and other mouth parts.
                     * Stuttering results in repetition, blocks or inability to say certain words, and/or the prolonging of words. An individual who stutters may also have distorted movements and facial expressions when trying to speak.
                     * Nodules are most frequently caused by vocal abuse or misuse. Polyps may be caused by prolonged vocal abuse, but may also occur after a single, traumatic event to the vocal folds. Speech may be hoarse, breathy, and painful to produce. 
Additionally, speech and language limitations might occur due to stroke, cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington’s Disease, oral and laryngeal cancer, hearing impairment, traumatic brain injury, dementia, chronic laryngitis, and vocal cord paralysis.

Speech-Language Impairment and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Speech-Language Impairment
People with speech-language impairments may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people who are aging will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Spina Bifida
Spina bifida is the most frequently occurring permanent birth defect. It affects approximately one out of every 2,875 newborns in the United States. It results from the failure of the spine to close properly during the first month of pregnancy. In severe cases, the spinal cord protrudes through the back and may be covered by skin or a thin membrane.
Spina Bifida and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).

About Stroke
Many individuals who have had strokes recover without limitations. Some individuals have temporary limitations while others have more long-term issues. Strokes can occur at any age, but are more common in people 65 years or older. Individuals who have had strokes can have short or long-term limitations that are cognitive or motor related. 
Accommodations for individuals who have had a stroke vary, but for those with vision loss, technologies are available to help them overcome these limitations. These technologies may help with reading printed material, accessing computer information, writing notes and completing forms, accessing a telephone, working with money, reading from an instrument, assembling parts, driving, working with light sensitivity, distinguishing colors, and being mobile.
 
Hemiparesis, which is a weakness of one side of the body, is one of many residual effects of having a stroke that limit physical or motor functioning.  Depending on the area of the brain where the stroke occurred, either the left or the right side of the body may experience a reduction in muscle strength. The degree to which motor functioning is limited depends on the individual and improvement in physical ability can be seen as a result of therapy and various forms of treatment. Hemiparesis can also limit an individual’s ability to perform a job or parts of a job, and those planning or preparing to return to work following a stroke may need to explore accommodation options. An individual experiencing hemiparesis may have difficulty walking, standing, balancing, climbing, grasping, or gripping objects for precision or detailed work tasks, and could experience general muscle fatigue or a lack of coordination. Depending on the type of job and the essential functions of the position, one or more accommodations may be needed to ensure that a return to work is successful for an individual with hemiparesis.
 
Strokes can also impact communication in a variety of ways depending on the part of the brain affected. Three typical speech and language impairments arising from stroke include dysarthria and apraxia, which impact one’s control over the movements of the muscles used in speaking; and aphasia, which causes difficulty understanding and using language. Some individuals who are recovering from stroke may have undergone evaluations to determine whether they would be helped by assistive technology such as augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices. This may be more likely for individuals with severe apraxia of speech that is not responding well to other treatments. They may also have learned or be in the process of learning compensatory techniques such as using a slower rate of speech or using other communication methods like typing, writing, drawing, or gesturing to support and enhance communication.
 
A stroke is a life-changing event that can affect an individual’s emotional well-being as much as his/her physical function. Many of us know and understand the physical (weakness, paralysis), cognitive (memory, processing), and communication (speech, language) challenges stoke survivors face, but we may not be aware of the challenges faced when mood disorders occur as result of a stroke. Although stroke effects are unpredictable, mood disorders such as depression, anxiety, and pseudo-bulbar affect (PBA) are common.
 
In general, accommodations could include the purchasing of equipment or assistive technology for an individual who uses a computer or performs detail-oriented assembly work. If an individual uses a mobility aid such as a scooter or wheelchair, worksite and/or workstation modifications may need to be made. A restructuring of a job, either to perform essential functions in a different way or reallocate marginal functions, flexibility in breaks, and leave to seek treatment may be potential accommodations to explore. Reassignment to a vacant position may be necessary if accommodations cannot be made in the current job or if an accommodation would pose an undue hardship.
 
JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations.
 
Stroke and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Stroke
People with stroke-related limitations may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people who are aging will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Stuttering
According to the Stuttering Foundation of America (SFA), over three million people in the United States stutter. Males are affected by stuttering four times more than females. When someone stutters the flow of speech can be interrupted by repetitions, prolongations, or periods where no sound is produced during the person’s effort to communicate. The person may also exhibit unusual facial and body movements while trying to speak.
There is no single cause of stuttering but current research is focusing on neurological causes. Stuttering is not caused by an emotional or nervous disorder. Some individuals who stutter can benefit from stuttering therapy and the use of fluency aids. The National Stuttering Association (NSA) indicates that adults who stutter may benefit from stuttering therapy to help their speech but that on-going maintenance may be needed to manage continued fluency.
An article written by William D. Parry, Chair of the NSA Advocacy Committee, states “Of the many obstacles faced by people who stutter perhaps the most devastating is discrimination in employment and educational opportunities.” Parry also notes that people who stutter are subject to negative stereotypes that prevent them from obtaining employment and promotional opportunities. According to Parry, common stereotypes include, “the widely accepted impression that stutterers are nervous, shy, quiet, self-conscious, withdrawn, tense, anxious, fearful, reticent, and guarded.”
Individuals who stutter can be highly qualified and capable workers if provided the chance to get their foot in the door. People who stutter are encouraged to talk about their stuttering with their employers to dispel stereotypes. Information about workplace accommodations may also be helpful.
Application and Interview-Information for the Employer:
                     * Be patient and listen
                     * Do not complete words or sentences for the individual
                     * Maintain conversational eye contact and focus on the content of communication rather than the delivery of the communication
                     * Relax and communicate as you would normally
                     * Provide interview questions in advance if possible to allow the individual time to prepare and deliver responses effectively
                     * Consider offering a personal interview as an alternative to a phone interview
                     * Become knowledgeable about stuttering
Application and Interview-Information for the Individual:
                     * Talk with the employer about stuttering and how it may impact job performance and provide suggestions for accommodations that may alleviate performance concerns (organizations such as the SFA and the NSA suggest that people who stutter should be open about their speaking abilities)
                     * Provide an informative cover letter and resume or vita to be used as marketing tools; market yourself and sell your abilities
                     * Be prepared for the interview by researching typical interview questions, preparing answers, and rehearsing prior to interview
                     * Request a personal interview if a telephone interview is scheduled but a personal interview would be more effective
                     * Plan in advance to use techniques and strategies that you have learned in speech therapy or support groups and that you find helpful in managing stuttering
On the Job:
                     * Talk with co-workers and clients about stuttering to educate them and ease their anxiety about communicating
                     * Use techniques and strategies that you have learned in speech therapy or support groups and that you find helpful in managing stuttering
                     * Try the following if using the telephone is difficult:
                     * When making calls, be prepared; know what needs to be said before dialing and write the main points down; use a script when applicable
                     * Rehearse the call with someone else
                     * Do not procrastinate; procrastination will only prolong anxiety and make the situation more stressful
                     * Answer telephone calls when ready and focus on the call, not on distractions around you
                     * Be prepared with easy ways to answer the telephone: “Hello this is Jim,” “Mary speaking,” “Good morning/afternoon,” etc.
                     * Practice using the telephone as often as possible
                     * Be prepared and be concise when speaking in public and get right to the point
                     * Use electronic communication options such as e-mail and instant messaging
                     * Use fluency aids if effective and seek out therapy options
                     * Be confident (SFA states that “Fluent speech breeds confidence, and confidence breeds fluent speech”)
Stuttering and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Stuttering
People who stutter may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people who stutter will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Substance Use Disorder
SUD is a health condition that refers to the recurrent use of alcohol and/or drugs that "causes clinically significant impairment," including related health conditions or failure to meet responsibilities at work, home, or school. SUD is a "treatable condition that affects a person's brain and behavior, leading to their inability to control their use of substances like legal or illegal drugs, alcohol, or medications.” When SUD progresses to addiction, it is defined (PDF) as a "chronic condition that can be treated but generally not cured, like diabetes or heart disease." Commonly known SUD subsets focus on specific types of substance use: 
                     * Opioid use disorder (OUD): OUD refers to the "problematic use of opioids causing significant impairment or distress" and is classified as a public health emergency in the United States.
                     * Alcohol use disorder (AUD): AUD is a “medical condition characterized by an impaired ability to stop or control alcohol use despite adverse social, occupational, or health consequences."

About Thyroid Disorders
There are many different thyroid disorders that exist. The most common ones include: Graves' disease, Hashimoto's disease, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, thyroid cancer, and thyroiditis. Key terms used to describe a specific thyroid disorder include:
                     * Hashimoto's Disease: Hashimoto's disease appears to be an inherited condition and is also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. It is most common in women who are between 30 and 50 years of age. With Hashimoto's Disease, the immune system attacks the thyroid gland in the neck, prohibiting it from producing hormones. Symptoms of Hashimoto's Disease are feelings of fullness/tightness in throat, trouble swallowing, swelling or bump in the front of the neck, tiredness, forgetfulness, depression, coarse dry skin, slow heartbeat, weight gain, constipation and intolerance to cold. Many people have no symptoms at all.
                     * Hyperthyroidism: Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone. It is 8 to 10 times more common in women than in men and is the 3rd most common thyroid problem in the US. Graves' disease is the most common form of hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism can mimic other health problems, making it difficult to diagnose. It can also cause a wide variety of symptoms including sudden weight loss, rapid or irregular heartbeat, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, tremors, sweating, changes in menstrual patterns, increased sensitivity to heat, change in bowel patterns, an enlarged thyroid gland at base of neck, fatigue, muscle weakness, and difficulty sleeping.
                     * Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces too little thyroid hormone. The most common cause of low thyroid production is Hashimoto's Disease, which is an autoimmune disease. The symptoms of hypothyroidism vary widely, depending on the severity of the hormone deficiency and develop slowly over years. Symptoms include increased sensitivity to cold, constipation, dry skin and hair, puffy face, hoarse voice, elevated cholesterol level, unexplained weight gain, muscle cramps, pain and stiffness in joints, muscle weakness, heavier menstrual periods, tiredness, and depression.
                     * Thyroid Cancer: Thyroid cancer is a cancerous tumor or growth located within the thyroid gland. Thyroid cancer is uncommon, accounting for only about 1 out of every 100 cancers in the United States. Thyroid cancer is often discovered by patients themselves when they see or feel a nodule or lump on the front of the neck.
                     * Thyroiditis: Thyroiditis is a general term used to describe different disorders in which the thyroid gland becomes inflamed.
Thyroid Disorders and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Thyroid Disorders
People with thyroid disorders may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people who are aging will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.

Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?

About Tourette Syndrome
Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a neurological disorder that is characterized by brief, sudden, repetitive, and unusual involuntary movements or unwanted sounds called tics. Symptoms can range from mild to severe to debilitating. 
The tics associated with TS are classified as either simple or complex. Simple tics involve a limited number of muscle groups. Some of the more common simple tics include eye blinking, nose twitching, mouth movements, and head / shoulder shrugging or jerking. More complex tics involving several muscle groups and may include facial grimacing combined with a head twist and a shoulder shrug, touching objects, hopping, jumping, bending, or twisting. Simple vocalizations might include repetitive throat-clearing, sniffing, or grunting sounds. More complex vocal tics include repeating words or phrases, sometimes obscene or swear words. More intense symptoms may considerably impede communication, daily functioning and quality of life. 
Symptoms of TS usually begin in childhood and can be seen as early as two years of age, but are more likely to occur between the ages of six to seven. Males are three to four times more likely than females to develop TS. In most cases, the severity, frequency, and disruptiveness of the symptoms diminish during adolescence and adulthood. In other cases, the symptoms actually disappear entirely, usually by early adulthood. Rarely will the symptoms worsen in adulthood. 
Many individuals with TSexperience additional related conditions such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), learning disabilities, sleep disorders, and anxiety and mood disorders. JAN's Accommodation Solutions: Executive Functioning Deficits is a publication detailing accommodations for individuals with limitations related to executive functioning. These ideas may be helpful in determining accommodations.
Tourette Syndrome and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).

About Vertigo
Vertigo is the sensation of spinning, whirling, or dizziness caused by a disturbance in balance. Vertigo can be described as either subjective or objective. An individual who experiences objective vertigo may feel like things in her environment are moving, while an individual with subjective vertigo feels as if she is moving. Vertigo can be caused by Meniere’s Disease, viral infections, central nervous system disorders such as stroke, migraines, multiple sclerosis, head trauma, acoustic neuroma (tumor), cardiovascular disorders, and sharp changes in blood pressure.

Vertigo can impact a person’s ability to work. Individuals with vertigo may be limited in activities such as getting out of bed; walking; traveling; working around moving objects, under bright or fluorescent lights, or at heights; climbing ladders; viewing a computer monitor; or working in an environment that has many colors or patterns (e.g., a patterned carpet).
Vertigo and the Americans with Disabilities Act
The ADA does not contain a definitive list of medical conditions that constitute disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines a person with a disability as someone who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities," (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. For more information about how to determine whether a person has a disability under the ADA, see How to Determine Whether a Person Has a Disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA).
Accommodating Employees with Vertigo
People with limitations from vertigo may develop some of the limitations discussed below, but seldom develop all of them. Also, the degree of limitation will vary among individuals. Be aware that not all people who are aging will need accommodations to perform their jobs and many others may only need a few accommodations. The following is only a sample of the possibilities available. Numerous other accommodation solutions may exist.
Questions to Consider:
                     1. What limitations is the employee experiencing?
                     2. How do these limitations affect the employee and the employee’s job performance?
                     3. What specific job tasks are problematic as a result of these limitations?
                     4. What accommodations are available to reduce or eliminate these problems? Are all possible resources being used to determine possible accommodations?
                     5. Once accommodations are in place, would it be useful to meet with the employee to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodations and to determine whether additional accommodations are needed?
                     6. Do supervisory personnel and employees need training?
